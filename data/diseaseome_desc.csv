It is defined as neoplasia of epithelial tissue that has glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenocarcinomas are part of the larger grouping of carcinomas, but are also sometimes called by more precise terms omitting the word, where these exist. Thus invasive ductal carcinoma, the most common form of breast cancer, is adenocarcinoma but does not use the term in its nameâ€”however, esophageal adenocarcinoma does to distinguish it from the other common type of esophageal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Several of the most common forms of cancer are adenocarcinomas, and the various sorts of adenocarcinoma vary greatly in all their aspects, so that few useful generalizations can be made about them.In the most specific usage (narrowest sense), the glandular origin or traits are exocrine; endocrine gland tumors, such as a VIPoma, an insulinoma, or a pheochromocytoma, are typically not referred to as adenocarcinomas but rather are often called neuroendocrine tumors. Epithelial tissue sometimes includes, but is not limited to, the surface layer of skin, glands, and a variety of other tissue that lines the cavities and organs of the body. Epithelial tissue can be derived embryologically from any of the germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, or mesoderm). To be classified as adenocarcinoma, the cells do not necessarily need to be part of a gland, as long as they have secretory properties. Adenocarcinoma is the malignant counterpart to adenoma, which is the benign form of such tumors. Sometimes adenomas transform into adenocarcinomas, but most do not.Well differentiated adenocarcinomas tend to resemble the glandular tissue that they are derived from, while poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas may not. By staining the cells from a biopsy, a pathologist can determine whether the tumor is an adenocarcinoma or some other type of cancer. Adenocarcinomas can arise in many tissues of the body owing to the ubiquitous nature of glands within the body, and, more fundamentally, to the potency of epithelial cells. While each gland may not be secreting the same substance, as long as there is an exocrine function to the cell, it is considered glandular and its malignant form is therefore named adenocarcinoma."47,46,"""Adenoma, periampullary (3)""","""APC, GS, FPC""",175100,5q21-q22,Cancer,Adenoma,"An adenoma (from Greek Î±Î´Î_Î_Î±Ï‚, adeno-, ""gland"" + -Ï_Î_Î±, -oma, ""tumor"") (/ËŒÃ_dáµ»ËˆnoÊ_mÉ™/; plural adenomas or adenomata /ËŒÃ_dáµ»ËˆnoÊ_máµ»tÉ™/) is a benign tumor of epithelial tissue with glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenomas can grow from many glandular organs, including the adrenal glands, pituitary gland, thyroid, prostate, and others. Some adenomas grow from epithelial tissue in nonglandular areas but express glandular tissue structure (as can happen in familial polyposis coli). Although adenomas are benign, over time they may transform to become malignant, at which point they are called adenocarcinomas. Most adenomas do not transform. But even while benign, they have the potential to cause serious health complications by compressing other structures (mass effect) and by producing large amounts of hormones in an unregulated, non-feedback-dependent manner (causing paraneoplastic syndromes). Some adenomas are too small to be seen macroscopically but can still cause clinical symptoms."48,47,"""Adenomas, multiple colorectal, 608456 (3)""",MUTYH,604933,1p34.3-p32.1,Cancer,Adenomas,49,47,"""Adenomas, salivary gland pleomorphic, 181030 (3)""","""PLAG1, SGPA, PSA""",603026,8q12,Cancer,Adenomas,50,47,Adenomatous polyposis coli (3),"""APC, GS, FPC""",175100,5q21-q22,Cancer,Adenomatous polyposis coli,"This article refers to the tumor suppressor APC, in which mutations lead to colon cancer.

It is a result of fatty acid digestive enzymes not breaking up the fats. These fats build up in the brain. They damage the myelin that surrounds nerves. This can cause seizures and hyperactivity. It can also cause problems with speaking, listening and understanding verbal instructions.In more detail, it is a disorder of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body. The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system, the adrenal cortex and the Leydig cells in the testes. Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes, and no clear pattern of genotype-phenotype correlation. As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life. Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form. It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state. The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive paraparesis in early adulthood (this form of the disease is typically known as adrenomyeloneuropathy).ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1, a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for ALD, a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein. The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of the various forms of ALD is not known. Biochemically, individuals with ALD show very high levels of unbranched, saturated, very long chain fatty acids, particularly cerotic acid (26:0). The level of cerotic acid in plasma does not correlate with clinical presentation. Treatment options for ALD are limited. Dietary treatment is with Lorenzo's oil.

It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernickeâ€“Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.Both environmental factors and genetics are associated with alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.Prevention of alcoholism is possible by regulating and limiting the sale of alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method involves the use of benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, disulfiram, or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.The World Health Organization estimates that as of 2010 there were 208 million people with alcoholism worldwide (4.1% of the population over 15 years of age). In the United States about 17 million (7%) of adults and 0.7 million (2.8%) of those age 12 to 17 years of age are affected. It is more common among males and young adults, becoming less common in middle and old age. It is the least common in Africa at 1.1% and has the highest rates in Eastern Europe at 11%. Alcoholism directly resulted in 139,000 deaths in 2013 up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. A total of 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol. It often reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years. In the United States it resulted in economic costs of $224 billion USD in 2006. Many terms, some insulting and others informal, have been used to refer to people affected by alcoholism including: tippler, drunkard, dipsomaniac, and souse. In 1979, the World Health Organization discouraged the use of ""alcoholism"" due to its inexact meaning, preferring ""alcohol dependence syndrome""."97,76,Aldolase A deficiency (3),ALDOA,103850,16q22-q24,Metabolic,Aldolase A deficiency,"Aldolase A deficiency, also called ALDOA deficiency or red cell aldolase deficiency, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder resulting in a deficiency of the enzyme aldolase A, which is found predominantly in red blood cells and muscle tissue.

It is caused by a mutation in the HGD gene for the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.5); if a person inherits abnormal copies from each parent (it is a recessive condition) the body accumulates an intermediate substance called homogentisic acid in the blood and tissues. Homogentisic acid and its oxidated form alkapton are excreted in the urine, giving it an unusually dark color. The accumulating homogentisic acid causes damage to cartilage (ochronosis, leading to osteoarthritis) and heart valves as well as precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. Symptoms usually develop in people over thirty years old, although the dark discoloration of the urine is present from birth.Apart from treatment of the complications (such as pain relief and joint replacement for the cartilage damage), vitamin C has been used to reduce the ochronosis and lowering of the homogentisic acid levels may be attempted with a low-protein diet. Recently the drug nitisinone has been found to suppresses homogentisic acid production, and research is ongoing as to whether it can improve symptoms. Alkaptonuria is a rare disease; it occurs in one in 250,000 people, but is more common in Slovakia and the Dominican Republic."103,82,"""Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, 300523 (3)""","""SLC16A2, DXS128, XPCT""",300095,Xq13.2,Neurological,Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome,"This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title; for example, its words are rearranged, or punctuation in the name is changed.

Signs and symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, red, itchy, and watery eyes, and swelling around the eyes. The fluid from the nose is usually clear. Symptoms onset is often within minutes following exposure and they can affect sleep, the ability to work, and the ability to concentrate at school. Those whose symptoms are due to pollen typically develop symptoms during specific times of the year. Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis.Allergic rhinitis is typically triggered by environmental allergens such as pollen, pet hair, dust, or mold. Inherited genetics and environmental exposures contribute to the development of allergies. Growing up on a farm and having multiple siblings decreases the risk. The underlying mechanism involves IgE antibodies attaching to the allergen and causing the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells. Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history in combination with a skin prick test or blood tests for allergen-specific IgE antibodies. These tests, however, are sometimes falsely positive. The symptoms of allergies resemble those of the common cold; however, they often last for more than two weeks and typically do not include a fever.Exposure to animals in early life might reduce the risk of developing allergies to them later. A number of medications may improve symptoms including nasal steroids, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, cromolyn sodium, and leukotriene receptor antagonists such as montelukast. Medications are, however, not sufficient or associated with side effects in many people. Exposing people to larger and larger amounts of allergen, known as allergen immunotherapy is often effective. The allergen may be given as injections just under the skin or as a tablet under the tongue. Treatment typically lasts three to five years after which benefits may be prolonged.Allergic rhinitis is the type of allergy that affects the greatest number of people. In Western countries, between 10â€“30% of people are affected in a given year. It is most common between the ages of twenty and forty. The first accurate description is from the 10th century physician Rhazes. Pollen was identified as the cause in 1859 by Charles Blackley. In 1906 the mechanism was determined by Clemens von Pirquet. The link with hay came about due to an early (and incorrect) theory that the symptoms were brought about by the smell of new hay."105,85,"""Alopecia universalis, 203655 (3)""","""HR, AU""",602302,8p21.2,Dermatological,Alopecia universalis,"Alopecia universalis (AU) or alopecia areata universalis is a medical condition involving rapid loss of all hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes.

AHC is named for the transient episodes, often referred to as attacks or episodes, of hemiplegia from which those with the disorder suffer. These hemiplegic attacks can cause anything from mild weakness to complete paralysis on one or both sides of the body, and they can vary greatly in duration. Attacks may also alternate from one side of the body to the other, or alternate between affecting one or both sides during a single attack. AHC is associated with many symptoms besides hemiplegia, and the majority of these become apparent in early infancy. AHC typically presents before the age of 18 months. Normally, hemiplegia and other associated symptoms cease completely with sleep, but they may recur upon waking. The disorder was only recently discovered, having first been characterized in 1971. AHC is also extremely rare â€“ approximately 1 in 1,000,000 people have this disorder. Besides hemiplegia, symptoms of the disorder include an extremely broad range of neurological and developmental impairments which are not well understood. Much of the literature about AHC is purposefully vague in this respect due to a lack of information on the disorder."118,97,"""Alveolar soft-part sarcoma, 606243 (3)""","""ASPCR1, RCC17, ASPL, ASPS""",606236,17q25,Cancer,Alveolar soft-part sarcoma, 119,98,"""Alzheimer disease-1, APP-related (3)""","""APP, AAA, CVAP, AD1""",104760,21q21,Neurological,Alzheimer disease-1, 120,98,"""Alzheimer disease-2, 104310 (3)""","""APOE, AD2""",107741,19q13.2,Neurological,Alzheimer disease-2, 121,98,"""Alzheimer disease-4, 606889 (3)""","""PSEN2, AD4, STM2""",600759,1q31-q42,Neurological,Alzheimer disease-4, 122,98,"""Alzheimer disease, late-onset, 104300 (3)""","""APBB2, FE65L1""",602710,4p14,Neurological,Alzheimer disease,"This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title; for example, its words are rearranged, or punctuation in the name is changed.

There are many different types of amyloidosis, each caused by formation of amyloid fibrils from different soluble precursor proteins in different patients. About 30 different proteins are known to form amyloid fibrils in humans and amyloidosis is named and classified according to the identity of the respective fibril protein. Amyloid deposits can be confined to only one part of the body or a single organ system in â€˜local amyloidosisâ€™ or they can be widely distributed in organs and tissues throughout the body in â€˜systemic amyloidosisâ€™. The clinical manifestations of amyloidosis are accordingly highly variable and confirmation of the presence of amyloid in the tissues can be challenging, so that diagnosis is often delayed."147,104,"""Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 8, 608627 (3)""","""VAPB, VAPC, ALS8""",605704,20q13.3,Neurological,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 8, 148,104,"""Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, due to SOD1 deficiency, 105400 (3)""","""SOD1, ALS1""",147450,21q22.1,Neurological,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) is a specific disorder that involves the death of neurons that control voluntary muscles.

Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight. If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods.The cause is not known. There appear to be some genetic components with identical twins more often affected than non-identical twins. Cultural factors also appear to play a role with societies that value thinness having higher rates of disease. Additionally, it occurs more commonly among those involved in activities that value thinness such as high-level athletics, modelling, and dancing. Anorexia often begins following a major life change or stress-inducing event. The diagnosis requires a significantly low weight. The severity of disease is based on body mass index (BMI) in adults with mild disease having a BMI of greater than 17, moderate a BMI of 16 to 17, severe a BMI of 15 to 16, and extreme a BMI less than 15. In children a BMI for age percentile of less than the 5th percentile is often used.Treatment of anorexia involves restoring a healthy weight, treating the underlying psychological problems, and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. While medications do not help with weight gain, they may be used to help with associated anxiety or depression. A number of types of therapy may be useful including an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child, known as Maudsley family therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Sometimes people require admission to hospital to restore weight. Evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding; however, is unclear. Some people will just have a single episode and recover while others may have many episodes over years. Many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight.Globally anorexia is estimated to affect two million people as of 2013. It is estimated to occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in Western countries at some point in their life. About 0.4% of young females are affected in a given year and it is estimated to occur ten times less commonly in males. Rates in most of the developing world are unclear. Often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood. While anorexia became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis. In 2013 it directly resulted in about 600 deaths globally up from 400 deaths in 1990. Eating disorders also increase a person's risk of death from a wide range of other causes including suicide. About 5% of people with anorexia die from complications over a ten-year period. The term anorexia nervosa was first used in 1873 by William Gull to describe this condition."178,126,Anterior segment anomalies and cataract (3),"""EYA1, BOR""",601653,8q13.3,Ophthamological,Anterior segment anomalies and cataract, 179,126,"""Anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis, 107250 (3)""","""FOXE3, FKHL12, ASMD""",601094,1p32,Ophthamological,Anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis,"Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) is a failure of the normal development of the tissues of the anterior segment of the eye.

""Syndactyly"" refers to webbing of fingers and toes.In embryology, the hands and feet have selective cells that die, called selective cell death or apoptosis, causing separation of the digits. In the case of acrocephalosyndactyly, selective cell death does not occur and skin, and rarely bone, between the fingers and toes fuses.The cranial bones are affected as well, similar to Crouzon syndrome and Pfeiffer syndrome. Craniosynostosis occurs when the fetal skull and facial bones fuse too soon in utero, disrupting normal bone growth. Fusion of different sutures leads to different patterns of growth on the skull. Examples include: trigonocephaly (fusion of the metopic suture), brachycephaly (fusion of the coronal suture and lambdoid suture bilaterally), dolichocephaly (fusion of the sagittal suture), plagiocephaly (fusion of coronal and lambdoidal sutures unilaterally), and oxycephaly or turricephaly (fusion of coronal and lambdoid sutures).Findings for the incidence of the syndrome in the population have varied, with estimates as low as 1 birth in 200,000 provided and 160,000 given as an average by older studies.

The desmosomes are composed of several proteins, and many of those proteins can have harmful mutations.The disease is a type of nonischemic cardiomyopathy that involves primarily the right ventricle. It is characterized by hypokinetic areas involving the free wall of the right ventricle, with fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium, with associated arrhythmias originating in the right ventricle.ARVD can be found in association with diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair, in an autosomal recessive condition called Naxos disease, because this genetic abnormality can also affect the integrity of the superficial layers of the skin most exposed to pressure stress.ARVC/D is an important cause of ventricular arrhythmias in children and young adults.

This enzyme plays a significant role in our bodies because it aids in breaking down certain sugars (for example, oligosaccharides) that are attached to specific proteins (for example, glycoproteins). Aspartylglucosaminuria itself is characterized as a lysosomal disease because it does deal with inadequate activity in an enzyme's function. Aspartylglucosaminidase functions to break down glycoproteins. These proteins are most abundant in the tissues of the body and in the surfaces of major organs, such as the liver, spleen, thyroid and nerves. When glycoproteins are not broken down, aspartylglucosaminidase backs up in the lysosomes along with other substances. This backup causes progressive damage to the tissues and organs."211,151,"""Asperger syndrome, 300494 (3)""",NLGN3,300336,Xq13,Psychiatric,Asperger syndrome,"Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.

Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Symptoms usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life.The exact cause of Asperger's is unknown.

Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as of 2015.There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness.

These accumulations contain both living, active WBCs (producing inflammation) and remnants of dead cells, including cholesterol and triglycerides. The remnants eventually include calcium and other crystallized materials within the outermost and oldest plaque. The ""fatty streaks"" reduce the elasticity of the artery walls. However, they do not affect blood flow for decades because the artery muscular wall enlarges at the locations of plaque. The wall stiffening may eventually increase pulse pressure; widened pulse pressure is one possible result of advanced disease within the major arteries.Atherosclerosis is therefore a syndrome affecting arterial blood vessels due to a chronic inflammatory response of WBCs in the walls of arteries. This is promoted by low-density lipoproteins (LDL, plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides) without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol from the macrophages by functional high-density lipoproteins (HDL). It is commonly referred to as a ""hardening"" or furring of the arteries. It is caused by the formation of multiple atheromatous plaques within the arteries.The plaque is divided into three distinct components:The atheroma (""lump of gruel"", from Greek á_€Î¸Î®ÏÅÎ± (athera), meaning ""gruel""), which is the nodular accumulation of a soft, flaky, yellowish material at the center of large plaques, composed of macrophages nearest the lumen of the arteryUnderlying areas of cholesterol crystalsCalcification at the outer base of older or more advanced lesions.Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that remains asymptomatic for decades. Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques, are separated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called vulnerable). The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated, but generally, stable atherosclerotic plaques, which tend to be asymptomatic, are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells. On the other hand, unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells, and the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen (also known as the fibrous cap) is usually weak and prone to rupture. Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material, such as collagen, to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen. Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (e.g., coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation, and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism. Apart from thromboembolism, chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen. Chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe (usually over 80%) that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient, resulting in ischemia.These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative. Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see vulnerable plaque), causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately five minutes. This catastrophic event is called an infarction. One of the most common recognized scenarios is called coronary thrombosis of a coronary artery, causing myocardial infarction (a heart attack). The same process in an artery to the brain is commonly called stroke. Another common scenario in very advanced disease is claudication from insufficient blood supply to the legs. Atherosclerosis affects the entire artery tree, but mostly larger, high-pressure vessels such as the coronary, renal, femoral, cerebral, and carotid arteries. These are termed ""clinically silent"" because the person having the infarction does not notice the problem and does not seek medical help, or when they do, physicians do not recognize what has happened."237,164,"""Atopy, 147050 (3)""","""SPINK5, LEKTI""",605010,5q32,Immunological,Atopy,"Atopy (/ËˆÃ_tÉ™piËê/ Greek á_€Ï„Î¿Ï€Î¯Î± - placelessness, out of place, special, unusual, extraordinary) or atopic syndrome is a predisposition toward developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions.Atopy may have a hereditary component, although contact with the allergen or irritant must occur before the hypersensitivity reaction can develop.The term atopy was coined by Coca and Cooke in 1923.

In an AV block, this message does not reach the ventricles or is impaired along the way.

Certain AV blocks can also be found as normal variants, such as in athletes or children, and are benign. Strong vagal stimulation may also produce AV block.

In the DSM V it is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum (ASDs), the other two being Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.Globally, autism is estimated to affect 21.7 million people as of 2013. As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 1â€“2 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD as of 2014, a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved."257,173,"""Autism, X-linked, 300495 (3)""","""NLGN4, KIAA1260, AUTSX2""",300427,Xp22.33,Psychiatric,Autism,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior.

These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.While autism is highly heritable, researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes.

The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 30-40 percent. Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are commonly associated.The causes are not clearly understood, but both environmental and genetic factors play a role. Many genes of small effect, contribute to risk. Environmental factors include a history of childhood abuse and long-term stress. It is divided into bipolar I disorder if there is at least one manic episode and bipolar II disorder if there are at least one hypomanic episode and one major depressive episode. In those with less severe symptoms of a prolonged duration the condition cyclothymic disorder may be present. If due to drugs or medical problems it is classified separately. Other conditions that may present in a similar manner include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia and substance use disorder as well as a number of medical conditions. Medical testing is not required for a diagnosis. However, blood tests or medical imaging can be done to rule out other problems.Treatment commonly includes psychotherapy, as well as medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. Examples of mood stabilizers that are commonly used include lithium and anticonvulsants. Treatment in hospital against a person's consent may be required at times as people may be a risk to themselves or others yet refuse treatment. Severe behavioral problems may be managed with short term antipsychotics or benzodiazepines. In periods of mania it is recommended that antidepressants be stopped. If antidepressants are used for periods of depression they should be used with a mood stabilizer. Electric shock therapy (ECT) may be helpful for those who do not respond to other treatments. If treatments are stopped, it is recommended that this be done slowly. Many individuals have financial, social or work-related problems due to the illness. These difficulties occur a quarter to a third of the time on average. The risk of death from natural causes such as heart disease is twice that of the general population. This is due to poor lifestyle choices and the side effects from medications.About 3 percent of people in the US are estimated to have bipolar disorder at some point in their life. Lower rates of around 1 percent are found in other countries. The most common age at which symptoms begin is 25. Rates appear to be similar in females as males. The economic costs of the disorder has been estimated at $45 billion for the United States in 1991. A large proportion of this was related to a higher number of missed work days, estimated at 50 per year. People with bipolar disorder often face problems with social stigma."324,205,"""Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, 135150 (3)""","""FLCN, BHD""",607273,17p11.2,Dermatological,Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome,325,207,"""Bladder cancer, 109800 (3)""","""FGFR3, ACH""",134934,4p16.3,Cancer,Bladder cancer,"Bladder cancer is any of several types of cancer arising from the epithelial lining (i.e., the urothelium) of the urinary bladder.

The condition was transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In the same year Jabs et al. reported a family that over two generations had granulomatous synovitis, uveitis and cranial neuropathies. The condition was transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. In 1981 Malleson et al. reported a family that had autosomal dominant synovitis, camptodactyly, and iridocyclitis. One member died of granulomatous arteritis of the heart and aorta. In 1982 Rotenstein reported a family with granulomatous arteritis, rash, iritis, and arthritis transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait over three generations. Then in 1990 Pastores et al. reported a kindred with a phenotype very similar to what Blau described and suggested that the condition be called Blau Syndrome (BS). They also pointed out the similarities in the families noted above to BS but also pointed out the significant differences in the phenotypes. In 1996 Tromp et al. conducted a genome wide search using affected and non affected members of the original family. A marker D16S298gave a maximum LOD score of 3.75 and put the BS susceptibility locus within the 16p12-q21 interval. Hugot et al. found a susceptibility locus for Crohn disease a granulomatous inflammation of the bowel on chromosome 16 close to the locus for BS. Based on the above information Blau suggested in 1998 that the genetic defect in BS and Crohn Disease might be the same or similar.Finally in 2001 Miceli-Richard et al. found the defect in BS to be in the nucleotide-binding domain of CARD15/NOD2. They commented in their article that mutations in CARD15 had also been found in Crohn Disease. Confirmation of the defect in BS being in the CARD15 gene was made by Wang et al. in 2002 using the BS family and others.(With that information the diagnosis of BS was not only determined by phenotype but now by genotype.Early onset sarcoidosis is BS without a family history, BS has been diagnosed in patients who have not only the classic triad but granuloma in multiple organs. Treatment has included the usual anti inflammatory drugs such as adrenal glucocorticoids, anti metabolites and also biological agents such as anti-TNF and infliximab all with varying degrees of success.The elucidation that the gene defect in BS involves the CARD15/NOD2 gene has stimulated many investigators to define how this gene operates as part of the innate immune system that responds to bacterial polysaccharides such as muramyl dipeptide to induce signaling pathways that induce cytokine responses that protect the organism. In BS the genetic defect seems to lead to over expression and poor control of the inflammatory response leading to widespread granulomatous inflammation and tissue damage. This reference provides an excellent review of not only the clinical aspects of BS but also the presumed pathogenetic mechanisms brought about by the gene defect.Unanswered questions are what is the stimulus that activates the aberrant immune response and if found could more precise therapy be used and what is the relationship to the specific gene defect and the phenotype?List of cutaneous conditions"330,209,Bleeding disorder due to defective thromboxane A2 receptor (3),TBXA2R,188070,19p13.3,Hematological,Bleeding disorder due to defective thromboxane A2 receptor, 331,209,"""Bleeding due to platelet ADP receptor defect, 600515 (3)""","""P2RX1, P2X1""",600845,17p13.3,Hematological,Bleeding due to platelet ADP receptor defect, 332,210,"""Blepharophimosis, epicanthus inversus, and ptosis, type 1, 110100 (3)""","""FOXL2, BPES, BPES1, PFRK, POF3""",605597,3q23,multiple,Blepharophimosis,"Blepharophimosis is a condition where the patient has bilateral ptosis with reduced lid size, vertically and horizontally.

In most cases, symptoms last for a few days then disappear without treatment, but sometimes the twitching is chronic and persistent, causing lifelong challenges. In those rare cases, the symptoms are often severe enough to result in functional blindness. The person's eyelids feel like they are clamping shut and will not open without great effort. People have normal eyes, but for periods of time are effectively blind due to their inability to open their eyelids. In contrast, the reflex blepharospasm is due to any pain in and around the eye.It is of two types: essential and reflex blepharospasm. The benign essential blepharospasm is a focal dystoniaâ€”a neurological movement disorder involving involuntary and sustained contractions of the muscles around the eyes. The term essential indicates that the cause is unknown, but fatigue, stress, or an irritant are possible contributing factors.Although there is no cure botulinum toxin injections may help temporarily.

In clinical genetics the most commonly used index of digit length is the dimensionless ratio of the length of the 3rd (middle) finger to the hand length. Both are expressed in the same units (centimeters, for example) and are measured in an open hand from the fingertip to the principal creases where the finger joins the palm and where the palm joins the wrist. A nomogram can be found in the Appendix of Jones, ed. Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation, 5th edition, Philadelphia: Saunders (1997)."376,225,"""Bradyopsia, 608415 (3)""","""R9AP, RGS9, PERRS""",607814,19q13.11,Ophthamological,Bradyopsia, 377,225,"""Bradyopsia, 608415 (3)""","""RGS9, PERRS""",604067,17q23-q24,Ophthamological,Bradyopsia, 378,226,Branchiootic syndrome (3),"""EYA1, BOR""",601653,8q13.3,Neurological,Branchiootic syndrome, 379,226,"""Branchiootorenal syndrome, 113650 (3)""","""EYA1, BOR""",601653,8q13.3,Neurological,Branchiootorenal syndrome,"This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title; for example, its words are rearranged, or punctuation in the name is changed.

Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.Risk factors for developing breast cancer include female sex, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 5â€“10% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to.The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with cancer, a number of treatments may be used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy. Types of surgery vary from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy. Breast reconstruction may take place at the time of surgery or at a later date. In those in whom the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, treatments are mostly aimed at improving quality of life and comfort.Outcomes for breast cancer vary depending on the cancer type, extent of disease, and person's age. Survival rates in the developed world are high, with between 80% and 90% of those in England and the United States alive for at least 5 years. In developing countries survival rates are poorer. Worldwide, breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all cases. In 2012 it resulted in 1.68 million cases and 522,000 deaths.

The main symptoms are pain, numbness and tingling, in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring fingers. Symptoms typically start gradually and during the night. Pain may extend up the arm. Weak grip strength may occur and after a long period of time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. In more than half of cases both sides are affected.Risk factors include obesity, repetitive wrist work, pregnancy, and rheumatoid arthritis. There is tentative evidence that hypothyroidism increases the risk. It is unclear if diabetes plays a role. The use of birth control pills does not affect the risk. Types of work that are associated include computer work, work with vibrating tools, and work that requires a strong grip. Diagnosis is suspected based on signs, symptoms, and specific physical tests and may be confirmed with electrodiagnostic tests. If muscle wasting at the base of the thumb is present, the diagnosis is likely.Being physically active can decrease the risk of developing CTS. Symptoms can be improved by wearing a wrist splint or with corticosteroid injections. Taking NSAIDs or gabapentin does not appear to be useful. Surgery to cut the transverse carpal ligament is effective with better results at a year compared to non surgical options. Further splinting after surgery is not needed. Evidence does not support magnet therapy.About 5% of people in the United States have carpal tunnel syndrome. It usually begins in adulthood and women are more commonly affected than men. Up to 33% of people may improve without specific treatment over approximately a year. Carpal tunnel syndrome was first fully described after World War II."481,276,"""Cartilage-hair hypoplasia, 250250 (3)""","""RMRP, RMRPR, CHH""",157660,9p21-p12,Skeletal,Cartilage-hair hypoplasia,"This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title; for example, its words are rearranged, or punctuation in the name is changed.

Any of these can result in vascular dementia.Hypertension (high blood pressure) is the most important contributing cause because it damages the blood vessel lining exposing collagen where platelets aggregate to initiate a repair. If maintained hypertension can change the structure of blood vessels (narrow, deformed).Blood pressure affects blood flow in narrowed vessels causing ischemic stroke, a rise in blood pressure can cause tearing of vessels leading to intracranial hemorrhage.A stroke usually presents with an abrupt onset of a neurologic deficit, attributable to a focal vascular lesion. The neurologic symptoms manifest within seconds because neurons lack glycogen, so energy failure is rapid."529,295,"""Ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal-1, infantile, 256730 (3)""","""PPT1, CLN1""",600722,1p32,Neurological,Ceroid lipofuscinosis, 530,296,"""Ceroid-lipofuscinosis, neuronal 2, classic late infantile, 204500 (3)""",CLN2,607998,11p15.5,Neurological,Ceroid-lipofuscinosis, 531,296,"""Ceroid-lipofuscinosis, neuronal-3, juvenile, 204200 (3)""","""CLN3, BTS""",607042,16p12.1,Neurological,Ceroid-lipofuscinosis, 532,296,"""Ceroid-lipofuscinosis, neuronal-5, variant late infantile, 256731 (3)""",CLN5,608102,13q21.1-q32,Neurological,Ceroid-lipofuscinosis, 533,296,"""Ceroid-lipofuscinosis, neuronal-6, variant late infantile, 601780 (3)""",CLN6,606725,15q21-q23,Neurological,Ceroid-lipofuscinosis, 534,296,"""Ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal 8, 600143 (3)""","""CLN8, EPMR""",607837,8pter-p22,Neurological,Ceroid lipofuscinosis, 535,296,"""Ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal, variant juvenile type, with granular osmiophilic deposits (3)""","""PPT1, CLN1""",600722,1p32,Neurological,Ceroid lipofuscinosis, 536,298,"""Cervical cancer, somatic, 603956 (3)""","""FGFR3, ACH""",134934,4p16.3,Cancer,Cervical cancer,"Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer.Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to be involved in the development of more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread.HPV vaccines protect against between two and seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected.Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000 deaths. This is about 8% of the total cases and total deaths from cancer. About 70% of cervical cancers occur in developing countries. In low-income countries, it is the most common cause of cancer death. In developed countries, the widespread use of cervical screening programs has dramatically reduced rates of cervical cancer. In medical research, the most famous cell line known as HeLa was developed from cervical cancer cells of a woman named Henrietta Lacks."537,299,"""CETP deficiency, 607322 (3)""",CETP,118470,16q21,Metabolic,CETP deficiency, 538,300,"""Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, 275630 (3)""","""ABHD5, CGI58, IECN2, NCIE2""",604780,3p21,Metabolic,Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome,539,301,"""Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, type 2F, 606595 (3)""","""HSPB1, HSP27, CMT2F""",602195,7q11.23,Neurological,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,"This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title; for example, its words are rearranged, or punctuation in the name is changed.

The disease results in progressive loss of vision, almost exclusively in males; in childhood, night blindness is the most common first symptom. As the disease progresses, vision loss results, frequently starting as an irregular ring that gradually expands both in toward central vision and out toward the extreme periphery; progression continues throughout the individual's life, where both the rate of change and the degree of visual loss are variable among those affected, even within the same family.The affected tissues include the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is the pigmented cell layer just outside the neurosensory retina that nourishes retinal visual cells; the RPE overlies the retinal visual cells and is firmly attached to the underlying choroid, where degeneration of the capillary lamina of choroid (choriocapillaris) is also observed. Photoreceptors of the RPE convert light into the electrical impulses that are transferred to the brain, where the images seen as a result are constructed; the vessels of the choriocapillaris provide oxygen and nutrients to the RPE and photoreceptor cells. In the early stages of CHD, the choroid and the retinal pigment epithelium begin to deteriorate, after which loss of photoreceptor occurs, leading to loss of vision. At a molecular level, the root cause of the disease is mutation leading to loss of a specific Rab escort protein 1 (REP1), which, with its partner REP2, are responsible for prenylation of Rab proteins, where the link between the build up of unprenylated Rab proteins and the developing blindness is not yet known.Medical approaches to the disease have resulted in the application of a diagnostic test for CHD, and 2014 saw the onset of clinical trials for gene therapies using viral vector-borne RP1 gene constructs aimed at protection of cells not yet lost to the disease. In these early clinical studies, patients have consistently shown improvements during the course of study; persistence data are in the process of being gathered."593,326,"""Chromosome 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, 606232 (3)""","""PSAP2, PROSAP2, KIAA1650""",606230,22q13.3,multiple,Chromosome 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, 594,327,"""Chronic granulomatous disease, autosomal, due to deficiency of CYBA, 233690 (3)""",CYBA,608508,16q24,Immunological,Chronic granulomatous disease,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (also known as Bridgesâ€“Good syndrome, Chronic granulomatous disorder, and Quie syndrome) is a diverse group of hereditary diseases in which certain cells of the immune system have difficulty forming the reactive oxygen compounds (most importantly the superoxide radical due to defective phagocyte NADPH oxidase) used to kill certain ingested pathogens.

These reactions process excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used for energy by the body, to make urea, which is excreted by the kidneys."614,336,"""Cleft lip/palate ectodermal dysplasia syndrome, 225000 (3)""","""HVEC, PVRL1, PVRR1, PRR1""",600644,11q23-q24,Developmental,Cleft lip/palate ectodermal dysplasia syndrome, 615,336,"""Cleft lip/palate, nonsyndromic, 608874 (3)""","""MSX1, HOX7, HYD1, OFC5""",142983,4p16.1,Developmental,Cleft lip/palate,616,336,"""Cleft palate with ankyloglossia, 303400 (3)""","""TBX22, CPX""",300307,Xq12-q21,Developmental,Cleft palate with ankyloglossia, 617,337,"""Cleidocranial dysplasia, 119600 (3)""","""RUNX2, CBFA1, PEBP2A1, AML3""",600211,6p21,Skeletal,Cleidocranial dysplasia,618,338,"""Coats disease, 300216 (3)""","""NDP, ND""",310600,Xp11.4,Ophthamological,Coats disease,"This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title; for example, its words are rearranged, or punctuation in the name is changed.

The mutation of specific genes in Cockayne syndrome is known, but the widespread effects and its relationship with DNA repair is yet to be well understood.It is named after English physician Edward Alfred Cockayne (1880â€“1956) who first described it in 1936 and re-described in 1946.

Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol.

Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found.

Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and feeling tired all the time.Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous.Bowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects.Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management focusing on improving quality of life and symptoms. Five year survival rates in the United States are around 65%. This, however, depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health. Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer making up about 10% of all cases. In 2012, there were 1.4 million new cases and 694,000 deaths from the disease.

It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and feeling tired all the time.Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous.Bowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects.Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management focusing on improving quality of life and symptoms.

Swelling of the white part of the eye may also occur. Itching of the eye is more common in cases due to allergies. Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes.The most common infectious causes are viral followed by bacterial. The viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a common cold. Viral and bacterial cases are easily spread between people. Allergies to pollen or animal hair is also a common cause. Diagnosis is often based on signs and symptoms. Occasionally a sample of the discharge is sent for culture.Prevention is partly by handwashing. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. In the majority of viral cases, there is no specific treatment. Most cases due to a bacterial infection will also resolve without treatment; however, antibiotics can shorten the illness. Those who wear contact lens and those with either gonorrhea or chlamydia as the cause should be treated. Allergic cases can be treated with antihistamine or mast cell inhibitor drops.About 3 to 6 million people get conjunctivitis each year in the United States. In adults viral causes are more common, while in children bacterial causes are more common. Typically people get better in one or two weeks. If there is visual loss, significant pain, sensitivity to light, signs of herpes, or a person is not improving after a week, further diagnosis and treatment may be required.

Heart abnormalities are common, including a very fast heartbeat (tachycardia), structural heart defects, and overgrowth of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Infants with Costello syndrome may be large at birth, but grow more slowly than other children and have difficulty feeding. Later in life, people with this condition have relatively short stature and many have reduced levels of growth hormones. It is a RASopathy.Beginning in early childhood, people with Costello syndrome have an increased risk of developing certain cancerous and noncancerous tumors. Small growths called papillomas are the most common noncancerous tumors seen with this condition. They usually develop around the nose and mouth or near the anus. The most frequent cancerous tumor associated with Costello syndrome is a soft tissue tumor called a rhabdomyosarcoma. Other cancers also have been reported in children and adolescents with this disorder, including a tumor that arises in developing nerve cells (neuroblastoma) and a form of bladder cancer (transitional cell carcinoma).Costello Syndrome was discovered by Dr Jack Costello, a New Zealand Paediatrician in 1977.

He noted the affected patients were a mother and her daughter, implying a genetic basis. First called ""craniofacial dysostosis"", the disorder was characterized by a number of clinical features. This syndrome is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor II, located on chromosome 10.Breaking down the name, ""craniofacial"" refers to the skull and face, and ""dysostosis"" refers to malformation of bone.Now known as Crouzon syndrome, the disease can be described by the rudimentary meanings of its former name. What occurs in the disease is that an infant's skull and facial bones, while in development, fuse early or are unable to expand. Thus, normal bone growth cannot occur. Fusion of different sutures leads to different patterns of growth of the skull.Examples include: trigonocephaly (fusion of the metopic suture), brachycephaly (fusion of the coronal suture), dolichocephaly (fusion of the sagittal suture), plagiocephaly (unilateral premature closure of lambdoid and coronal sutures), oxycephaly (fusion of coronal and lambdoidal sutures), Kleeblattschaedel (premature closure of all sutures)."759,391,Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (3),"""FGFR3, ACH""",134934,4p16.3,Skeletal,Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans,760,392,"""Cryptorchidism, bilateral, 219050 (3)""","""LGR8, GREAT""",606655,13q13.1,Renal,Cryptorchidism,"Cryptorchidism is the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum.

Without intervention, an undescended testicle will usually descend during the first year of life, but to reduce these risks, undescended testes can be brought into the scrotum in infancy by a surgical procedure called an orchiopexy.Although cryptorchidism nearly always refers to congenital absence or maldescent, a testis observed in the scrotum in early infancy can occasionally ""reascend"" (move back up) into the inguinal canal.

Long-term issues include difficulty breathing and coughing up mucus as a result of frequent lung infections. Other signs and symptoms include sinus infections, poor growth, fatty stool, clubbing of the fingers and toes, and infertility in males, among others. Different people may have different degrees of symptoms.CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly normal. CFTR is involved in production of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. When CFTR is not functional, secretions which are usually thin instead become thick. The condition is diagnosed by a sweat test and genetic testing. Screening of infants at birth takes place in some areas of the world.There is no cure for cystic fibrosis. Lung infections are treated with antibiotics which may be given intravenously, inhaled, or by mouth. Sometimes the antibiotic azithromycin is used long term. Inhaled hypertonic saline and salbutamol may also be useful. Lung transplantation may be an option if lung function continues to worsen. Pancreatic enzyme replacement and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation are important, especially in the young. While not well supported by evidence, many people use airway clearance techniques such as chest physiotherapy. The average life expectancy is between 42 and 50 years in the developed world. Lung problems are responsible for death in 80% of people with cystic fibrosis.CF is most common among people of Northern European ancestry and affects about one out of every 3,000 newborns. About one in 25 people are carriers. It is least common in Africans and Asians. It was first recognized as a specific disease by Dorothy Andersen in 1938, with descriptions that fit the condition occurring at least as far back as 1595. The name cystic fibrosis refers to the characteristic fibrosis and cysts that form within the pancreas."771,400,"""Cystinosis, atypical nephropathic (3)""",CTNS,606272,17p13,Renal,Cystinosis,"Cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by the abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine.

Other common symptoms include emotional problems, problems with language, and a decrease in motivation. A person's consciousness is usually not affected. A dementia diagnosis requires a change from a person's usual mental functioning and a greater decline than one would expect due to aging. These diseases also have a significant effect on a person's caregivers.The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which makes up 50% to 70% of cases. Other common types include vascular dementia (25%), Lewy body dementia (15%), and frontotemporal dementia. Less common causes include normal pressure hydrocephalus, Parkinson's disease, syphilis, and Creutzfeldtâ€“Jakob disease among others. More than one type of dementia may exist in the same person. A small proportion of cases run in families. In the DSM-5, dementia was reclassified as a neurocognitive disorder, with various degrees of severity. Diagnosis is usually based on history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood work used to rule out other possible causes. The mini mental state examination is one commonly used cognitive test. Efforts to prevent dementia include trying to decrease risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and obesity. Screening the general population for the disorder is not recommended.There is no cure for dementia. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil are often used and may be beneficial in mild to moderate disorder. Overall benefit, however, may be minor. For people with dementia and those who care for them many measures can improve their lives. Cognitive and behavioral interventions may be appropriate. Educating and providing emotional support to the caregiver is important. Exercise programs are beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and potentially improve outcomes. Treatment of behavioral problems with antipsychotics is common but not usually recommended due to the little benefit and side effects, including an increased risk of death.Globally, dementia affects 36 million people. About 10% of people develop the disorder at some point in their lives. It becomes more common with age. About 3% of people between the ages of 65â€“74 have dementia, 19% between 75 and 84 and nearly half of those over 85 years of age. In 2013 dementia resulted in about 1.7 million deaths up from 0.8 million in 1990. As more people are living longer, dementia is becoming more common in the population as a whole. For people of a specific age, however, it may be becoming less frequent, at least in the developed world, due to a decrease in risk factors. It is one of the most common causes of disability among the old. It is believed to result in economic costs of 604 billion USD a year.

Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes less than two to seven days. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.Dengue is spread by several species of mosquito of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.A novel vaccine for dengue fever has been approved in three countries, but it is not yet commercially available. Prevention is by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.Dengue has become a global problem since the Second World War and is common in more than 110 countries. Each year between 50 and 528 million people are infected and approximately 10,000 to 20,000 die. The earliest descriptions of an outbreak date from 1779.

It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features, and mild to moderate intellectual disability. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental age of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely.The parents of the affected individual are typically genetically normal. The extra chromosome occurs by random chance. There is no known behavior or environmental factor that changes the risk. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing, or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. Since the introduction of screening, pregnancies with the diagnosis are often terminated. Regular screening for health problems common in Down syndrome is recommended throughout the person's life.There is no cure for Down syndrome. Education and proper care have been shown to improve quality of life. Some children with Down syndrome are educated in typical school classes, while others require more specialized education. Some individuals with Down syndrome graduate from high school and a few attend post-secondary education. In adulthood, about 20% in the United States do paid work in some capacity with many requiring a sheltered work environment. Support in financial and legal matters is often needed. Life expectancy is around 50 to 60 years in the developed world with proper health care.Down syndrome is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities in humans. It occurs in about one per 1000 babies born each year. In 2013, Down syndrome was present in 8.5 million individuals and resulted in 36,000 deaths down from 43,000 deaths in 1990. It is named after John Langdon Down, the British doctor who fully described the syndrome in 1866. Some aspects of the condition were described earlier by Jean-Ã‰tienne Dominique Esquirol in 1838 and Ã‰douard SÃ©guin in 1844. The genetic cause of Down syndromeâ€”an extra copy of chromosome 21â€”was identified by French researchers in 1959."909,446,"""Doyne honeycomb degeneration of retina, 126600 (3)""","""EFEMP1, FBNL, DHRD""",601548,2p16,Ophthamological,Doyne honeycomb degeneration of retina, 910,447,"""Drug addiction, susceptibility to (3)""",FAAH,602935,1p35-p34,Psychiatric,Drug addiction,911,449,"""Duane-radial ray syndrome, 607323 (3)""","""SALL4, HSAL4""",607343,20q13.13-q13.2,multiple,Duane-radial ray syndrome,Duane-radial ray syndrome is a rare disorder that affects the eyes and causes abnormalities of bones in the arms and hands.912,450,"""Dubin-Johnson syndrome, 237500 (3)""","""ABCC2, CMOAT""",601107,10q24,Metabolic,Dubin-Johnson syndrome,"This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title; for example, its words are rearranged, or punctuation in the name is changed.

The disorder is caused by a mutation in the gene dystrophin, located on the human X chromosome, which codes for the protein dystrophin. Dystrophin is an important component within muscle tissue that provides structural stability to the dystroglycan complex (DGC) of the cell membrane. While both sexes can carry the mutation, females are rarely affected.Symptoms usually appear in boys between the ages of 2 and 3 and may be visible in early infancy. Even though symptoms do not appear until early infancy, laboratory testing can identify children who carry the active mutation at birth. Progressive proximal muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis associated with loss of muscle mass is observed first. Eventually this weakness spreads to the arms, neck, and other areas. Early signs may include pseudohypertrophy (enlargement of calf and deltoid muscles), low endurance, and difficulties in standing without help or an inability to walk up stairs. As the condition progresses, muscle tissue experiences wasting and is eventually replaced by fat and fibrotic tissue (fibrosis). By age 10, braces may be required to aid in walking but most patients are wheelchair dependent by age 12. Later symptoms may include abnormal bone development that lead to skeletal deformities, including curvature of the spine. Due to progressive deterioration of muscle, loss of movement occurs, eventually leading to paralysis. Intellectual impairment may or may not be present but if present, does not progressively worsen as the child ages. The average life expectancy for individuals afflicted with DMD is around 25."914,452,"""Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen disease, 223800 (3)""","""DYM, FLJ90130, DMC, SMC""",607461,18q12-q21.1,multiple,Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen disease, 915,453,Dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (3),ALB,103600,4q11-q13,Hematological,Dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, 916,454,"""Dysautonomia, familial, 223900 (3)""","""IKBKAP, IKAP""",603722,9q31,Neurological,Dysautonomia,"Dysautonomia (or autonomic neuropathy) is a term for various conditions in which the autonomic nervous system (ANS) does not work correctly.

Ectodermal dysplasias can occur in any race but are much more prevalent in caucasians than any other group and especially in fair caucasians.Ectodermal dysplasias are described as ""heritable conditions in which there are abnormalities of two or more ectodermal structures such as the hair, teeth, nails, sweat glands, salivary glands, cranial-facial structure, digits and other parts of the body."""948,466,"""Ectodermal dysplasia/skin fragility syndrome, 604536 (3)""",PKP1,601975,1q32,Dermatological,Ectodermal dysplasia/skin fragility syndrome, 949,467,"""Ectopia lentis, familial, 129600 (3)""","""FBN1, MFS1, WMS""",134797,15q21.1,Ophthamological,Ectopia lentis,Ectopia lentis is a displacement or malposition of the eye's crystalline lens from its normal location.

The hands and feet of people with ectrodactyly are often described as ""claw-like"" and may include only the thumb and one finger (usually either the little finger, ring finger, or a syndactyly of the two) with similar abnormalities of the feet.It is a rare form of a congenital disorder in which the development of the hand is disturbed. It is a type I failure of formation â€“ longitudinal arrest. The central ray of the hand is affected and usually appears without proximal deficiencies of nerves, vessels, tendons, muscles and bones in contrast to the radial and ulnar deficiencies. The cleft hand appears as a V-shaped cleft situated in the centre of the hand. The digits at the borders of the cleft might be syndactilyzed, and one or more digits can be absent. In most types, the thumb, ring finger and little finger are the less affected parts of the hand. The incidence of cleft hand varies from 1 in 90,000 to 1 in 10,000 births depending on the used classification. Cleft hand can appear unilateral or bilateral, and can appear isolated or associated with a syndrome.Split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) is characterized by underdeveloped or absent central digital rays, clefts of hands and feet, and variable syndactyly of the remaining digits. SHFM is a heterogeneous condition caused by abnormalities at one of multiple loci, including SHFM1 (SHFM1 at 7q21-q22), SHFM2 (Xq26), SHFM3 (FBXW4/DACTYLIN at 10q24), SHFM4 (TP63 at 3q27), and SHFM5 (DLX1 and DLX 2 at 2q31). SHFM3 is unique in that it is caused by submicroscopic tandem chromosome duplications of FBXW4/DACTYLIN. SHFM3 is considered 'isolated' ectrodactyly and does not show a mutation of the tp63 gene."952,470,"""Ehlers-Danlos due to tenascin X deficiency, 606408 (3)""","""TNXB, TNX, TNXB1, TNXBS, TNXB2""",600985,6p21.3,Connective tissue disorder,Ehlers-Danlos due to tenascin X deficiency, 953,470,"""Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type, 130020 (3)""","""TNXB, TNX, TNXB1, TNXBS, TNXB2""",600985,6p21.3,Connective tissue disorder,Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title; for example, its words are rearranged, or punctuation in the name is changed.

Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems.

Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (glands) around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur. Squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the epithelial cells that line the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett's esophagus). The most common causes of the squamous-cell type are: tobacco, alcohol, very hot drinks, and a poor diet. The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco, obesity, and acid reflux.The disease is diagnosed by biopsy done by an endoscope (a fiberoptic camera). Prevention includes stopping smoking and eating a healthy diet. Treatment is based on the cancer's stage and location, together with the person's general condition and individual preferences. Small localized squamous-cell cancers may be treated with surgery alone with the hope of a cure. In most other cases, chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is used along with surgery. Larger tumors may have their growth slowed with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the presence of extensive disease or if the affected person is not fit enough to undergo surgery, palliative care is often recommended. Outcomes are related to the extent of the disease and other medical conditions, but generally tend to be fairly poor, as diagnosis is often late. Five-year survival rates are around 13% to 18%.As of 2012, esophageal cancer is the eighth-most common cancer globally with 456,000 new cases during the year. It caused about 400,000 deaths that year, up from 345,000 in 1990. Rates vary widely among countries, with about half of all cases occurring in China.

The condition is also associated with other diseases that influence fat metabolism. When this process of fat metabolism is disrupted, the fat can accumulate in the liver in excessive amounts, thus resulting in a fatty liver. It is difficult to distinguish alcoholic FLD from nonalcoholic FLD, and both show microvesicular and macrovesicular fatty changes at different stages.Accumulation of fat may also be accompanied by a progressive inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), called steatohepatitis. By considering the contribution by alcohol, fatty liver may be termed alcoholic steatosis or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the more severe forms as alcoholic steatohepatitis (part of alcoholic liver disease) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)."1102,528,Favism (3),"""G6PD, G6PD1""",305900,Xq28,Metabolic,Favism,1103,530,"""Fechtner syndrome, 153640 (3)""","""MYH9, MHA, FTNS, DFNA17""",160775,22q11.2,multiple,Fechtner syndrome,"Fechtner syndrome is a variant of Alport syndrome with leukocyte inclusions and macrothrombocytopenia."1104,531,"""Feingold syndrome, 164280 (3)""","""MYCN, NMYC, ODED, MODED""",164840,2p24.1,multiple,Feingold syndrome,"Feingold syndrome (also called oculodigitoesophagoduodenal syndrome) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disorder.

The hypoandrogenism with spermatogenesis syndrome included: (a) eunuchoidism, (b) testis with normal spermatogenesis and full volume, with mature spermatozoids in a high proportion of seminiferous tubes and undifferentiated and immature Leydig cells (c) full functional compensation through the administration of chorionic gonadotropin hormone, while hCG is administered (d) total urinary gonadotrophins within normal limits (e) this definition implies the normal activity of the pituitary and the absence of congenital malformations in general. In describing five other similar cases in 1953, Mc Cullagh & al   coined the term fertile eunuch introducing it in the English literature. Unfortunately, this term is incorrect and should not be employed. Indeed, these patients are not really eunuchs. Moreover, as it will be explained later, they are not usually fertile if not treated.A first step in the understanding of the physiopathology of Pasqualini syndrome was the absence of Lutheinizing Hormone (LH) in plasma and urine of patients. The second breakthrough was the functional and genetic studies that validated the hypothesis of a functional deficit of LH in these men. Inactivating LH mutations will then also be described in some women. Different groups      demonstrated in these cases a LH with varying degrees of immunological activity but biologically inactive in most of the patients, due to one or more inactivating mutations in the LHB gene.

Nearly half of all children with fragile X syndrome meet the criteria for a diagnosis of autism. It is an inherited cause of intellectual disability especially among boys. It results in a spectrum of intellectual disabilities ranging from mild to severe as well as physical characteristics such as an elongated face, large or protruding ears, and large testicles (macroorchidism), and behavioral characteristics such as stereotypic movements (e.g. hand-flapping), and social anxiety.Fragile X syndrome is associated with the expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat affecting the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome, resulting in a failure to express the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is required for normal neural development. Depending on the length of the CGG repeat, an allele may be classified as normal (unaffected by the syndrome), a premutation (at risk of fragile X associated disorders), or full mutation (usually affected by the syndrome). A definitive diagnosis of fragile X syndrome is made through genetic testing to determine the number of CGG repeats. Testing for premutation carriers can also be carried out to allow for genetic counseling. The first complete DNA sequence of the repeat expansion in someone with the full mutation was generated by scientists in 2012 using SMRT sequencing.There is currently no drug treatment that has shown benefit specifically for fragile X syndrome. However, medications are commonly used to treat symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity, anxiety, and aggression.

Signs and symptoms are initially non-specific. They may include headaches, personality changes, nausea, and symptoms similar to that of a stroke. Worsening of symptoms is often rapid. This can progress to unconsciousness.The cause of most cases is unclear. Uncommon risk factors include genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis and Li Fraumeni syndrome and previous radiation therapy. Glioblastomas represent 15% of brain tumors. They can either start from normal brain cells or develop from an already existing low-grade astrocytoma. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of CT scan, MRI scan, and tissue biopsy.There is no clear way to prevent the disease. Typically treatment involves surgery after which chemotherapy and radiation therapy is used. The medication temozolomide is frequently used as part of chemotherapy. High dose steroids may be used to help reduce swelling and decrease symptoms. It is unclear if trying to remove all or simply most of the cancer is better.Despite maximum treatment, the cancer usually recurs. The most common length of survival following diagnosis is 12 to 15 months with less than 3 to 5% of people surviving greater than five years. Without treatment survival is typically 3 months. About 3 per 100,000 people develop the disease a year. It most often begins around 64 years of age and occurs more commonly in males than females.

A deaf person has little to no hearing. Hearing loss may occur in one or both ears. In children hearing problems can affect the ability to learn language and in adults it can cause work related difficulties. In some people, particularly older people, hearing loss can result in loneliness. Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent.Hearing loss may be caused by a number of factors, including: genetics, ageing, exposure to noise, some infections, birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins. A common condition that results in hearing loss is chronic ear infections. Certain infections during pregnancy such as rubella may also cause problems. Hearing loss is diagnosed when hearing testing finds that a person is unable to hear 25 decibels in at least one ear. Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns. Hearing loss can be categorised as mild, moderate, severe, or profound.Half of hearing loss is preventable. This includes by immunisation, proper care around pregnancy, avoiding loud noise, and avoiding certain medications. The World Health Organization recommends that young people limit the use of personal audio players to an hour a day in an effort to limit exposure to noise. Early identification and support are particularly important in children. For many hearing aids, sign language, cochlear implants and subtitles are useful. Lip reading is another useful skill some develop. Access to hearing aids, however, is limited in many areas of the world.As of 2013 hearing loss affects about 1.1 billion people to some degree. It causes disability in 5% (360 to 538 million) and moderate to severe disability in 124 million people. Of those with moderate to severe disability 108 million live in low and middle income countries. Of those with hearing loss it began in 65 million during childhood. Those who use sign language and are members of Deaf culture see themselves as having a difference rather than an illness. Most members of Deaf culture oppose attempts to cure deafness and some within this community view cochlear implants with concern as they have the potential to eliminate their culture. The term hearing impairment is often viewed negatively as it emphasises what people cannot do."1258,647,"""Heart block, nonprogressive, 113900 (3)""","""SCN5A, LQT3, IVF, HB1, SSS1""",600163,3p21,Cardiovascular,Heart block,"Heart block is a disease or inherited condition that causes a fault within the heart's natural pacemaker due to some kind of obstruction (or ""block"") in the electrical conduction system of the heart. Despite the severe-sounding name, heart block may often cause no symptoms at all in some cases, or occasional missed heartbeats in other cases (which can cause lightheadedness, syncope (fainting), and palpitations), or may require an artificial pacemaker to be implanted, depending upon exactly where in the heart conduction is being impaired and how significantly it is affected.In severe cases where the heart's ability to control and trigger heartbeats may be completely ineffective or unreliable, heart block can usually be treated by inserting an artificial pacemaker, a medical device that provides correct electrical impulses to trigger heart beats, compensating for the natural pacemaker's unreliability. Therefore, heart block frequently has no effects, or mild and occasional effects, and is not life-threatening in the vast majority of cases, and is usually treatable in more serious cases.The human heart uses electrical signals to maintain and initiate the regular heart beat in a living person; incorrect conduction can lead to mild or serious symptoms depending upon the location of the blockage and how severely conduction is being blocked. Conduction is initiated by the sinoatrial node (""sinus node"" or ""SA node""), and then travels to the atrioventricular node (""AV node"") which also contains a secondary ""pacemaker"" that acts as a backup for the SA nodes, then to the bundle of His and then via the bundle branches to the point of the apex of the fascicular branches (shown in the diagram on the right). Blockages are therefore classified based on where the blockage occurs - namely the SA node (""Sinoatrial block""), AV node (""AV block"" or AVB), and at or below the bundle of His (""Intra-Hisian"" or ""Infra-Hisian block"" respectively). Infra-Hisian blocks may occur at the left or right bundle branches (""bundle branch block"") or the fascicles of the left bundle branch (""fascicular block"" or ""Hemiblock""). SA and AV node blocks are each divided into three degrees, with second degree blocks being divided into two types (written either ""type I or II"" or ""type 1 or 2""). The term ""Wenckebach block"" is also used for second degree type 1 blocks of either the SA or AV node; in addition second degree blocks type 1 and 2 are also sometimes known as ""Mobitz 1"" and ""Mobitz 2"".Clinically speaking, the blocks tend to have more serious potential the closer they are to the 'end' of the electrical path (the muscles of the heart regulated by the heartbeat), and less serious effects the closer they are to the 'start' (at the SA node), because the potential disruption becomes greater as more of the 'path' is 'blocked' from its 'end' point. Therefore, most of the important heart blocks are AV nodal blocks and infra-Hisian blocks. SA blocks are usually of lesser clinical significance, since in the event of SA block, the AV node contains a secondary pacemaker which would still maintain a heart rate of around 40 - 60 beats per minute, sufficient for consciousness and much of daily life in the majority of individuals."1259,647,"""Heart block, progressive, type I, 113900 (3)""","""SCN5A, LQT3, IVF, HB1, SSS1""",600163,3p21,Cardiovascular,Heart block,"Heart block is a disease or inherited condition that causes a fault within the heart's natural pacemaker due to some kind of obstruction (or ""block"") in the electrical conduction system of the heart.

SA blocks are usually of lesser clinical significance, since in the event of SA block, the AV node contains a secondary pacemaker which would still maintain a heart rate of around 40 - 60 beats per minute, sufficient for consciousness and much of daily life in the majority of individuals."1260,648,Heinz body anemia (3),HBA2,141850,16pter-p13.3,Hematological,Heinz body anemia,1261,648,"""Heinz body anemias, alpha- (3)""",HBA1,141800,16pter-p13.3,Hematological,Heinz body anemias, 1262,648,"""Heinz body anemias, beta- (3)""",HBB,141900,11p15.5,Hematological,Heinz body anemias, 1263,649,"""HELLP syndrome, maternal, of pregnancy (3)""","""HADHA, MTPA""",600890,2p23,Metabolic,HELLP syndrome,"HELLP syndrome is a life-threatening obstetric complication usually considered to be a variant or complication of pre-eclampsia.

It predominantly, but not exclusively, affects children. Most cases are preceded by an episode of infectious, sometimes bloody, diarrhea acquired as a foodborne illness or from a contaminated water supply caused by E. coli O157:H7, other non-o157:H7 E. coli serotypes, Shigella, and Campylobacter. A variety of viruses have also been implicated as a causative agent. It is now the most common cause of acquired acute renal failure in childhood. It is a medical emergency and carries a 5â€“10% mortality rate; of the remainder, the majority recover without major consequences but a small proportion develop chronic kidney disease, meaning at some point they will likely become reliant on renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation). The primary target appears to be the vascular endothelial cell. This may explain the pathogenesis of HUS, in which a characteristic renal lesion is capillary microangiopathy.HUS was first defined as a syndrome in 1955. The more common form of the disease, Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli HUS (STEC-HUS), is triggered by the infectious agent E. coli O157:H7, and several other non-O157:H7 E. coli serotypes. Certain Shiga toxin secreting strains of Shigella dysenteriae can also cause HUS. Approximately 5% of cases are classified as pneumococcal HUS, which results from infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the agent that causes traditional lobar pneumonia. There is also a rare, chronic, and severe form known as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), which is caused by genetic defects resulting in chronic, uncontrolled complement activation. Both STEC-HUS and aHUS cause endothelial damage, leukocyte activation, platelet activation, and widespread inflammation and multiple thromboses in the small blood vessels, a condition known as systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which leads to thrombotic events as well as organ damage/failure and death."1289,662,"""Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, familial, 2, 603553 (3)""","""PRF1, HPLH2""",170280,10q22,Hematological,Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), also known as haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (British spelling), and hemophagocytic or haemophagocytic syndrome, is an uncommon hematologic disorder.

Mitral stenosis can also lead to pulmonary hemosiderosis. Hemosiderin collects throughout the body in hemochromatosis. Hemosiderin deposition in the liver is a common feature of hemochromatosis and is the cause of liver failure in the disease. Selective iron deposition in the beta cells of pancreatic islets leads to diabetes due to distribution of transferrin receptor on the beta cells of islets  and in the skin leads to hyperpigmentation. Hemosiderin deposition in the brain is seen after bleeds from any source, including chronic subdural hemorrhage, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, cavernous hemangiomata. Hemosiderin collects in the skin and is slowly removed after bruising; hemosiderin may remain in some conditions such as stasis dermatitis. Hemosiderin in the kidneys has been associated with marked hemolysis and a rare blood disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.Hemosiderin may deposit in diseases associated with iron overload.

Homocysteine can be recycled into methionine or converted into cysteine with the aid of certain B-vitamins.A high level of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia) makes a person more prone to endothelial cell injury, which leads to inflammation in the blood vessels, which in turn may lead to atherogenesis, which can result in ischemic injury. Hyperhomocysteinemia is therefore a possible risk factor for coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque blocks blood flow to the coronary arteries, which supply the heart with oxygenated blood.Hyperhomocysteinemia has been correlated with the occurrence of blood clots, heart attacks and strokes, though it is unclear whether hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for these conditions.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) can result in severe hyperphenylalaninemia. Phenylalanine concentrations ([phe]) are routinely screened in newborns by the neonatal heel prick (Guthrie test), which takes a few drops of blood from the heel of the infant. Standard [phe] concentrations in unaffected persons are about 60ÂµM: [phe] concentrations in persons with untreated phenylketonuria may be many times that (600ÂµM to 2400ÂµM), which indicate that the child is at risk for severe intellectual disability. Phenylketonuria is classed as an autosomal recessive condition: in heterozygous form, [phe] shows a moderate elevation, perhaps two-fold over that of unaffected homozygotes, which is classified as hyperphenylalaninemia (hyper- + phenylalanine + -emia = high [phe] in blood).Persons with the genotype for PKU are unaffected in utero, because maternal circulation prevents buildup of [phe]. After birth, PKU in newborns is treated by a special diet with highly restricted phenylalanine content. Persons with genetic predisposition to PKU have normal mental development on this diet. Previously, it was thought safe to withdraw from the diet in the late teens or early twenties, after the central nervous system was fully developed; recent studies suggest some degree of relapse, and a continued phenylalanine-restricted diet is now recommended.PKU or hyperphenylalaninemia may also occur in persons without the PKU genotype. If the mother has the PKU genotype but has been treated so as to be asymptomatic, high levels of [phe] in the maternal blood circulation may affect the non-PKU fetus during gestation. Mothers successfully treated for PKU are advised to return to the [phe]-restricted diet during pregnancy.A small subset of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia shows an appropriate reduction in plasma phenylalanine levels with dietary restriction of this amino acid; however, these patients still develop progressive neurologic symptoms and seizures and usually die within the first 2 years of life (""malignant"" hyperphenylalaninemia).

In either case, dietary therapy corrects the hyperphenylalaninemia. However, THB is also a cofactor for two other hydroxylation reactions required in the syntheses of neurotransmitters in the brain: the hydroxylation of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan and of tyrosine to L-dopa.

Thyrotoxicosis is the condition that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism. Some, however, use the terms interchangeably. Signs and symptoms vary between people and may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, poor tolerance of heat, diarrhea, enlargement of the thyroid, and weight loss. Symptoms are typically less in the old and during pregnancy. An uncommon complication is thyroid storm in which an event such as an infection results in worsening symptoms such as confusion and a high temperature and often results in death. The opposite is hypothyroidism, when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone.Graves' disease is the cause of about 50% to 80% of case of hyperthyroidism in the United States. Other causes include multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, inflammation of the thyroid, eating too much iodine, and too much synthetic thyroid hormone. A less common cause is a pituitary adenoma. The diagnosis may be suspected based on signs and symptoms and then confirmed with blood tests. Typically blood tests show a low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and raised T3 or T4. Radioiodine uptake by the thyroid, thyroid scan, and TSI antibodies may help determine the cause.Treatment depends partly on the cause and severity of disease. There are three main treatment options: radioiodine therapy, medications, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy involves taking iodine-131 by mouth which is then concentrated in and destroys the thyroid over weeks to months. The resulting hypothyroidism is treated with synthetic thyroid hormone. Anti-thyroid medications such as methimazole and propylthiouracil directly inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. Surgery to remove the thyroid is another option. This may be used in those with very large thyroids or when cancer is a concern. First-line treatment in the United States is typically radioactive iodine in the United States, and anti-thyroid drugs in Europe, with contingencies for patient modality.In the United States hyperthyroidism affects about 1.2% of the population. It occurs between two and ten times more often in women. Onset is commonly between 20 and 50 years of age. Overall the disease is more common in those over the age of 60 years."1428,757,"""Hypertriglyceridemia, one form (3)""",APOA1,107680,11q23,Metabolic,Hypertriglyceridemia,"Hypertriglyceridemia denotes high (hyper-) blood levels (-emia) of triglycerides, the most abundant fatty molecule in most organisms.

It is also accompanied by a lack of sense of smell (anosmia) or a highly reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). The condition can occur in both males and females but is more commonly diagnosed in males. Left untreated patients with Kallmann syndrome will almost invariably be infertile.Kallmann syndrome occurs due to a failure of the hypothalamus to release GnRH at the appropriate time as a result of the GnRH releasing neurones not migrating into the correct location during embryonic development.Kallmann syndrome is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Approximately 50% of HH cases occur with no sense of smell and are classified as Kallmann syndrome. Apart from the sense of smell there is no difference in the diagnosis or treatment between a case of HH or a case of Kallmann syndrome.The terminology used when describing cases of HH can vary. The term congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) is now often used. Other terms used include idiopathic / isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nHH) or hypothalamic hypogonadism. The term HH can be used to cover all cases, including Kallmann syndrome.The term isolated GnRH deficiency (IGD) has increasingly been used to describe this group of conditions as it highlights the primary cause of these conditions and distinguishes them from other conditions such as Klinefelter syndrome or Turner syndrome which share some similar symptoms but have a totally different etiology.The term hypogonadism describes a low level of circulating sex hormones; testosterone in males and oestrogen and progesterone in females. Hypogonadism can occur through a number of different methods. The use of the term hypogonadotropic relates to the fact that the hypogonadism found in HH is caused by a disruption in the production of the gonadotropin hormones normally released by the anterior pituitary gland known as luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).LH and FSH have a direct action on the ovaries in women and testes in men. The absence of LH and FSH means that initially puberty will not commence at the correct time and subsequently the ovaries and testes will not perform their normal fertility function with the maturation and release of eggs in women and the production of sperm in men alongside their role in producing the sex hormones.The underlying cause of the failure in production of LH and FSH is the impairment of the hypothalamus to release the hormone GnRH which in normal circumstances induces the production of LH and FSH. Without the correct release of GnRH the pituitary gland is unable to release LH and FSH which in turn prevents the ovaries and testes from functioning correctly. This failure in GnRH production can either be due to the absence of the GnRH releasing neurones inside the hypothalamus or the inability of the hypothalamus to release GnRH in the correct pulsatile manner to ensure LH and FSH release from the pituitary.HH can occur as an isolated condition with just the LH and FSH production being affected or it can occur in combined pituitary deficiency conditions such as CHARGE syndrome.To date at least twenty five different genes have so far been implicated in causing Kallmann syndrome or other forms of HH through a disruption in the production or activity of GnRH. The genes involved cover all forms of inheritance and no one gene defect has been shown to be common to all cases which makes genetic testing and inheritance prediction very problematic.Kallmann syndrome was described in a paper published in 1944 by Franz Josef Kallmann, a German-American geneticist. The link between anosmia and hypogonadism had already been noted however, in particular by the Spanish doctor Aureliano Maestre de San Juan in 1856. The condition is sometimes known by his name in Spanish speaking countries.The condition has a low prevalence, estimated as being between 1 in 4,000 and 1 in 10,000 for male HH cases overall and 1 in 50,000 for Kallmann syndrome. It is three to five times more common in males than females. Though whether this is a true sex imbalance or a reflection on how difficult KS / HH is to diagnose correctly, especially in females, has yet to be fully established. A more recent paper published in 2011 gave the incidence in the Finnish population at 1 in 48,000, with a sex distinction of 1 in 30,000 for males and 1 in 125,000 for females."1555,837,"""Kanzaki disease, 609242 (3)""",NAGA,104170,22q11,Metabolic,Kanzaki disease,1556,838,"""Kaposi sarcoma, susceptibility to, 148000 (3)""","""IL6, IFNB2, BSF2""",147620,7p21,Immunological,Kaposi sarcoma,1557,839,Kappa light chain deficiency (3),IGKC,147200,2p12,Immunological,Kappa light chain deficiency, 1558,840,"""Kartagener syndrome, 244400 (3)""","""DNAH11, DNAHC11""",603339,Chr.7,multiple,Kartagener syndrome,1559,840,"""Kartagener syndrome, 244400 (3)""","""DNAH5, HL1, PCD, CILD3""",603335,5p15-p14,multiple,Kartagener syndrome,1560,840,"""Kartagener syndrome, 244400 (3)""","""DNAI1, CILD1, ICS, PCD""",604366,9p21-p13,multiple,Kartagener syndrome,1561,841,"""Kenny-Caffey syndrome-1, 244460 (3)""","""TBCE, KCS, KCS1, HRD""",604934,1q42-q43,multiple,Kenny-Caffey syndrome-1, 1562,842,"""Keratitis, 148190 (3)""","""PAX6, AN2, MGDA""",607108,11p13,Ophthamological,Keratitis,"Keratitis is a condition in which the eye's cornea, the front part of the eye, becomes inflamed.

It is associated with abnormalities in the gene coding for matrix gla protein (MGP). Being an autosomal recessive disorder, it may be inherited from two unaffected, abnormal MGP-carrying parents. Thus, people who inherit two affected MGP genes will likely inherit KS.It was first identified in 1972 as a novel rare genetic disorder sharing similar symptoms with chondrodysplasia punctata. Multiple forms of chondrodysplasia punctata share symptoms consistent with KS including abnormal cartilage calcification, forceful respiration, brachytelephalangism, hypotonia, psychomotor delay, and conductive deafness, yet peripheral pulmonary stenosis remains unique to KS.No chromosomal abnormalities are reported in affected individuals, suggesting that familial consanguinity relates to the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Also, despite largely abnormal calcification of regions including the larynx, tracheobronchial tree, nose, pinna (anatomy), and epiglottis, patients exhibit normal serum calcium and phosphate levels."1573,850,"""Kindler syndrome, 173650 (3)""","""KIND1, URP1, C20orf42""",607900,20p13,Dermatological,Kindler syndrome,"Kindler syndrome (also known as ""Bullous acrokeratotic poikiloderma of Kindler and Weary,"", ""Congenital poikiloderma with blisters and keratoses,"" ""Congenital poikiloderma with bullae and progressive cutaneous atrophy,"" ""Hereditary acrokeratotic poikiloderma,"" ""Hyperkeratosisâ€“hyperpigmentation syndrome,"" ""Acrokeratotic poikiloderma,"" and ""Wearyâ€“Kindler syndrome"") is a rare congenital disease of the skin caused by a mutation in the KIND1 gene."1574,851,Kininogen deficiency (3),KNG,228960,3q27,Hematological,Kininogen deficiency, 1575,853,"""Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, 149000 (3)""","""VG5Q, HUS84971, FLJ10283""",608464,5q13.3,multiple,Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome,"This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title; for example, its words are rearranged, or punctuation in the name is changed.

What characterizes kniest dysplasia from other type II Osteochondrodysplasia is the level of severity and the dumb-bell shape of shortened long tubular bones. This condition was first diagnosed by Dr. Wilhelm Kniest in 1952. Dr. Kniest noticed that his 50 year old patient was having difficulties with restricted joint mobility. The patient had a short stature and was also suffering from blindness. Upon analysis of the patient's DNA, Dr. Kniest discovered that a mutation had occurred at a splice site of the COL2A1 gene. This condition is very rare and occurs less than 1 in 1,000,000 people. Males and females have equal chances of having this condition. Currently, there is no cure for kniest dysplasia.

A usual occurrence is a degeneration of the vitreous humour and the retina, two components of the eye. This breakdown often results in the separation of the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye) from the eye, called retinal detachment, which can be recurrent.Knobloch syndrome is caused by mutations in an autosomal recessive inherited gene. These mutations have been found in the COL18A1 gene that instructs for the formation of a protein that builds collagen XVIII. This type of collagen is found in the basement membranes of various body tissues. Its deficiency in the eye is thought to be responsible for affecting normal eye development. There are three types of Knobloch syndrome. When caused by mutations in the COL18A1 gene it is called Knobloch syndrome type 1. The genes causing types II and III have yet to be identified.Knobloch syndrome is also characterised by cataracts, dislocated lens with skull defects such as occipital encephalocele and occipital aplasia. Encephalocele is a neural tube defect where the skull has not completely closed and sac-like protrusions of the brain can push through the skull; (it can also result from other causes). In Knoblochâ€™s syndrome this is usually seen in the occipital region, and aplasia is the underdevelopment of tissue again in this reference in the occipital area.It is named after Knobloch who first described the syndrome in 1971."1578,856,"""Krabbe disease, 245200 (3)""",GALC,606890,14q31,Neurological,Krabbe disease,"Krabbe disease (also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy or galactosylceramide lipidosis) is a rare, often fatal degenerative disorder that affects the myelin sheath of the nervous system.

Like most toxic heavy metals, lead interferes with a variety of body processes and is toxic to many organs and tissues, including the heart, bones, intestines, kidneys, and reproductive and nervous systems. The brain is the organ most sensitive to lead exposure. Lead interferes with the development of the nervous system and is therefore particularly toxic to children, causing potentially permanent learning and behavior disorders including violence. Symptoms include abdominal pain, confusion, headache, anemia, irritability, and in severe cases seizures, coma, and death.Routes of exposure to lead include contaminated air, water, soil, food, and consumer products. Occupational exposure is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults. According to estimates made by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), more than 3 million workers in the United States are potentially exposed to lead in the workplace. One of the largest threats to children is lead paint that exists in many homes, especially older ones; thus children in older housing with chipping paint or lead dust from moveable window frames with lead paint are at greater risk. Prevention of lead exposure can range from individual efforts (e.g., removing lead-containing items such as piping or blinds from the home) to nationwide policies (e.g., laws that ban lead in products, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, or provide for cleanup and mitigation of contaminated soil, etc.)Elevated lead in the body can be detected by the presence of changes in blood cells visible with a microscope and dense lines in the bones of children seen on X-ray, but the main tool for diagnosis is measurement of the blood lead level. When blood lead levels are recorded, the results indicate how much lead is circulating within the blood stream, not the amount stored in the body. There are two units for reporting blood lead level, either micrograms per deciliter (Âµg/dl), or micrograms per 100 grams (Âµg/100 g) of whole blood, which are numerically equivalent. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the standard elevated blood lead level for adults to be 10 Âµg/dl of the whole blood. For children the number is set much lower at 5 Âµg/dl of blood as of 2012 down from a previous 10 Âµg/dl. Children are especially prone to the health effects of lead. As a result, blood lead levels must be set lower and closely monitored if contamination is possible. The major treatments are removal of the source of lead and chelation therapy (administration of agents that bind lead so it can be excreted).Humans have been mining and using this heavy metal for thousands of years, poisoning themselves in the process. Although lead poisoning is one of the oldest known work and environmental hazards, the modern understanding of the small amount of lead necessary to cause harm did not come about until the latter half of the 20th century. No safe threshold for lead exposure has been discoveredâ€”that is, there is no known sufficiently small amount of lead that will not cause harm to the body."1590,872,"""Leanness, inherited (3)""","""AGRP, ART, AGRT""",602311,16q22,Nutritional,Leanness, 1591,873,"""Leber congenital amaurosis, 204000 (3)""","""CRB1, RP12""",604210,1q31-q32.1,Ophthamological,Leber congenital amaurosis,1592,873,"""Leber congenital amaurosis, 204000 (3)""","""CRX, CORD2, CRD""",602225,19q13.3,Ophthamological,Leber congenital amaurosis,1593,873,"""Leber congenital amaurosis, 204000 (3)""","""RPGRIP1, LCA6, CORD9""",605446,14q11,Ophthamological,Leber congenital amaurosis,1594,873,"""Leber congenital amaurosis-2, 204100 (3)""","""RPE65, RP20""",180069,1p31,Ophthamological,Leber congenital amaurosis-2, 1595,873,"""Leber congenital amaurosis, 604393 (3)""","""AIPL1, LCA4""",604392,17p13.1,Ophthamological,Leber congenital amaurosis,1596,873,"""Leber congenital amaurosis, type I, 204000 (3)""","""GUCY2D, GUC2D, LCA1, CORD6""",600179,17p13.1,Ophthamological,Leber congenital amaurosis,1597,873,"""Leber congenital amaurosis, type III, 604232 (3)""","""RDH12, LCA3""",608830,14q23.3,Ophthamological,Leber congenital amaurosis,1598,874,Left-right axis malformations (3),ACVR2B,602730,3p22-p21.3,Developmental,Left-right axis malformations, 1599,874,Left-right axis malformations (3),"""EBAF, TGFB4, LEFTY2, LEFTA, LEFTYA""",601877,1q42.1,Developmental,Left-right axis malformations, 1600,875,"""Left ventricular noncompaction, familial isolated, 1, 604169 (3)""","""DTNA, D18S892E, DRP3, LVNC1""",601239,18q12.1-q12.2,Cardiovascular,Left ventricular noncompaction, 1601,875,"""Left ventricular noncompaction with congenital heart defects, 606617 (3)""","""DTNA, D18S892E, DRP3, LVNC1""",601239,18q12.1-q12.2,Cardiovascular,Left ventricular noncompaction with congenital heart defects, 1602,876,"""Legionaire disease, susceptibility to, 608556 (3)""","""TLR5, TIL3""",603031,1q41-q42,Immunological,Legionaire disease, 1603,877,"""Leigh syndrome, 256000 (3)""","""BCS1L, FLNMS, GRACILE""",603647,2q33,Neurological,Leigh syndrome,1604,877,"""Leigh syndrome, 256000 (3)""","""DLD, LAD, PHE3""",238331,7q31-q32,Neurological,Leigh syndrome,1605,877,"""Leigh syndrome, 256000 (3)""",NDUFS3,603846,11p11.11,Neurological,Leigh syndrome,1606,877,"""Leigh syndrome, 256000 (3)""","""NDUFS4, AQDQ""",602694,5q11.1,Neurological,Leigh syndrome,1607,877,"""Leigh syndrome, 256000 (3)""","""NDUFS7, PSST""",601825,19p13,Neurological,Leigh syndrome,1608,877,"""Leigh syndrome, 256000 (3)""",NDUFS8,602141,11q13,Neurological,Leigh syndrome,1609,877,"""Leigh syndrome, 256000 (3)""","""NDUFV1, UQOR1""",161015,11q13,Neurological,Leigh syndrome,1610,877,"""Leigh syndrome, 256000 (3)""","""SDHA, SDH2, SDHF""",600857,5p15,Neurological,Leigh syndrome,1611,877,"""Leigh syndrome, due to COX deficiency, 256000 (3)""",SURF1,185620,9q34,Neurological,Leigh syndrome,1612,877,"""Leigh syndrome due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, 256000 (3)""",COX15,603646,10q24,Neurological,Leigh syndrome due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, 1613,877,"""Leigh syndrome, French-Canadian type, 220111 (3)""","""LRPPRC, LRP130, LSFC""",607544,2p21-p16,Neurological,Leigh syndrome,1614,877,"""Leigh syndrome, X-linked, 308930 (3)""","""PDHA1, PHE1A""",312170,Xp22.2-p22.1,Neurological,Leigh syndrome,1615,878,"""Leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer, 605839 (3)""",FH,136850,1q42.1,Cancer,Leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer, 1616,878,"""Leiomyomatosis, diffuse, with Alport syndrome, 308940 (3)""",COL4A6,303631,Xq22.3,Cancer,Leiomyomatosis,1617,880,"""Leopard syndrome, 151100 (3)""","""PTPN11, PTP2C, SHP2, NS1""",176876,12q24.1,multiple,Leopard syndrome,1618,881,"""Leprechaunism, 246200 (3)""",INSR,147670,19p13.2,Developmental,Leprechaunism,1619,882,"""Leprosy, susceptibility to, 607572 (3)""","""PRKN, PARK2, PDJ""",602544,6q25.2-q27,Immunological,Leprosy,"Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease (HD), is a long term infection caused by the bacilli Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Initially, infections are without symptoms and typically remain this way from 5 to as long as 20 years. Symptoms that develop include granulomas of the nerves, respiratory tract, skin, and eyes. This may result in a lack of ability to feel pain and thus loss of parts of extremities due to repeated injuries or infection due to unnoticed wounds. Weakness and poor eyesight may also be present.Leprosy is spread between people. It is believed to occur through a cough or contact with fluid from the nose of an infected person. Leprosy occurs more commonly among those living in poverty and is believed to be transmitted by respiratory droplets. Contrary to popular belief, it is not highly contagious. The two main types of disease are based on the number of bacteria present: paucibacillary and multibacillary. The two types are differentiated by the number of poorly pigmented, numb skin patches present, with paucibacillary having five or fewer and multibacillary having more than five. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding acid-fast bacilli in a biopsy of the skin or by detecting the DNA using polymerase chain reaction.Leprosy is curable with a treatment known as multidrug therapy (MDT). Treatment for paucibacillary leprosy is with the medications dapsone and rifampicin for six months. Treatment for multibacillary leprosy consists of rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine for 12 months. These treatments are provided free of charge by the World Health Organization. A number of other antibiotics may also be used. Globally in 2012, the number of chronic cases of leprosy was 189,000, down from some 5.2 million in the 1980s. The number of new cases was 230,000. Most new cases occur in 16 countries, with India accounting for more than half. In the past 20 years, 16 million people worldwide have been cured of leprosy. About 200 cases are reported per year in the United States.Leprosy has affected humanity for thousands of years. The disease takes its name from the Latin word lepra, which means ""scaly"", while the term ""Hansen's disease"" is named after the physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen. Separating people by placing them in leper colonies still occurs in places such as India, China, and Africa. However, most colonies have closed since leprosy is not very contagious. Social stigma has been associated with leprosy for much of history, which continues to be a barrier to self-reporting and early treatment. Some consider the word ""leper"" offensive, preferring the phrase ""person affected with leprosy"". World Leprosy Day was started in 1954 to draw awareness to those affected by leprosy."1620,883,"""Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, 127300 (3)""","""SHOX, GCFX, SS, PHOG""",312865,Xpter-p22.32,Skeletal,Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis,"This is a redirect from a page name that does not have diacritical marks (accents, umlauts, etc.) to essentially the same page name with diacritical marks.

It is a facultative anaerobic bacterium, capable of surviving in the presence or absence of oxygen. It can grow and reproduce inside the host's cells and is one of the most virulent foodborne pathogens, with 20 to 30% of food borne listeriosis infections in high-risk individuals may be fatal. Responsible for an estimated 1,600 illnesses and 260 deaths in the United States (U.S.) annually, listeriosis is the third-leading cause of death among foodborne bacterial pathogens, with fatality rates exceeding even Salmonella and Clostridium botulinum. In the European Union listeriosis follows an upward trend that began in 2008, causing 2,161 confirmed cases and 210 reported deaths in 2014, 16% more than in 2013. Listeriosis mortality rates are also in the EU higher than for other food-borne pathogens.Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium, in the division Firmicutes, named after Joseph Lister. Its ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 Â°C permits multiplication at typical refrigeration temperatures, greatly increasing its ability to evade control in human foodstuffs. Motile via flagella at 30 Â°C and below, but usually not at 37 Â°C, L. monocytogenes can instead move within eukaryotic cells by explosive polymerization of actin filaments (known as comet tails or actin rockets).Studies suggest up to 10% of human gastrointestinal tracts may be colonized by Listeria monocytogenes.Nevertheless, clinical diseases due to Listeria monocytogenes are more frequently recognized by veterinarians, especially as meningoencephalitis in ruminants. See: listeriosis in animals.Due to its frequent pathogenicity, causing meningitis in newborns (acquired transvaginally), pregnant mothers are often advised not to eat soft cheeses such as Brie, Camembert, feta, and queso blanco fresco, which may be contaminated with and permit growth of Listeria monocytogenes. It is the third-most-common cause of meningitis in newborns.

Risk factors for common types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include autoimmune diseases, HIV/AIDS, infection with human T-lymphotropic virus, immunosuppressant medications, and some pesticides. Eating large amounts of red meat may also increase the risk. Diagnosis, if enlarged lymph nodes are present, is usually by lymph node biopsy.

Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and/or brain.Treatment may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein.

A macrocytic class of anemia is an anemia (defined as blood with an insufficient concentration of hemoglobin) in which the red blood cells (erythrocytes) are larger than their normal volume. The normal erythrocyte volume in humans is about 80 to 100 femtoliters (fL= 10âˆ’15 L). In metric terms the size is given in equivalent cubic micrometers (1 Î_m3 = 1 fL). The condition of having erythrocytes which (on average) are too large, is called macrocytosis. In contrast, in microcytic anemia, the erythrocytes are smaller than normal.In a macrocytic anemia the larger red cells are always associated with insufficient numbers of cells and often also insufficient hemoglobin content per cell. Both of these factors work to the opposite effect of larger cell size, to finally result in a total blood hemoglobin concentration that is less than normal (i.e., anemia).Macrocytic anemia is not a disease in the sense of having a single pathology, but is rather a condition. As such, it is the class name for a set of pathologies that all produce somewhat the same red blood cell abnormality. Many specific pathologies are known which result in macrocytic-type anemias. Some of these produce slightly different sets of appearances in blood cells that are detectable from red and white cell morphology, and others are only detectable with chemical testing."1745,936,"""Macrothrombocytopenia, 300367 (3)""","""GATA1, GF1, ERYF1, NFE1""",305371,Xp11.23,Hematological,Macrothrombocytopenia, 1746,2937,"""Macular corneal dystrophy, 217800 (3)""","""CHST6, MCDC1""",605294,16q22,Ophthamological,Macular corneal dystrophy,"Macular corneal dystrophy, also known as Fehr corneal dystrophy named for German ophthalmologist Oskar Fehr (1871-1959), is a rare pathological condition affecting the stroma of cornea.

Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.The disease is most commonly transmitted by an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood. The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by P. falciparum because P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species P. knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity.The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito-control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no effective vaccine exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes an artemisinin. The second medication may be either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if an artemisinin is not available. It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance. Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.The disease is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator. This includes much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In 2015, there were 214 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 438,000 deaths, 90% of which occurred in Africa.

It carries a high mortality rate if untreated but is a vaccine-preventable disease. While best known as a cause of meningitis, widespread blood infection can result in sepsis, which is a more damaging and dangerous condition. Meningitis and meningococcemia are major causes of illness, death, and disability in both developed and under-developed countries.There are approximately 2,600 cases of bacterial meningitis per year in the United States, and on average 333,000 cases in developing countries. The case fatality rate ranges between 10 and 20 percent. The incidence of endemic meningococcal disease during the last 13 years ranges from 1 to 5 per 100,000 in developed countries, and from 10 to 25 per 100,000 in developing countries. During epidemics the incidence of meningococcal disease approaches 100 per 100,000. Meningococcal vaccines have sharply reduced the incidence of the disease in developed countries.The disease's pathogenesis is not fully understood. The pathogen colonises a large number of the general population harmlessly, but in some very small percentage of individuals it can invade the blood stream, and the entire body but notably limbs and brain, causing serious illness. Over the past few years, experts have made an intensive effort to understand specific aspects of meningococcal biology and host interactions, however the development of improved treatments and effective vaccines is expected to depend on novel efforts by workers in many different fields.While meningococcal disease is not as contagious as the common cold (which is spread through casual contact), it can be transmitted through saliva and occasionally through close, prolonged general contact with an infected person."1819,988,"""Menkes disease, 309400 (3)""","""ATP7A, MNK, MK, OHS""",300011,Xq12-q13,Neurological,Menkes disease,"Menkes disease (MNK), also known as Menkes syndrome, is a X-linked recessive disorder that affects copper levels in the body, leading to copper deficiency.

It is more common in males than females, because it only takes one copy of the X-linked recessive gene to be expressed for a male to develop the disease. In order for females to develop the disorder they would need to express two copies of the gene, one on each X chromosome to develop the disorder. MNK is characterized by kinky hair, growth failure, and deterioration of the nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the copper transport gene, ATP7A, which is responsible for making a protein that is important for regulating the copper levels in the body.The disorder was originally described by John Hans Menkes (1928â€“2008) et al. in 1962.Alternative names:Copper Transport DiseaseSteely Hair DiseaseKinky Hair DiseaseMenkes Kinky Hair Syndrome"1820,990,"""Mental retardation, nonsyndromic, autosomal recessive, 249500 (3)""","""PRSS12, BSSP3""",606709,4q25-q26,Neurological,Mental retardation,"This is a redirect from a page that has been moved (renamed).

The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly.Greater than 80% of mesothelioma is caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Often it takes around 40 years for the disease to begin. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer.Prevention centers around reducing exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, may be used to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and pemetrexed. The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States.In 2013 about 50,000 people had mesothelioma and 34,000 died from the disease. Rates of mesothelioma vary in different areas of the world. Rates are higher in Australia and Great Britain and lower in Japan. It occurs in about 3,000 people per year in the United States. It occurs more often in males than females. Rates of disease have increased since the 1950s. Diagnosis typically occurs after the age of 65 and most deaths occur around 70 years old. The disease was rare before the commercial use of asbestos."1852,996,"""Metachromatic leukodystrophy, 250100 (3)""",ARSA,607574,22q13.31-qter,Neurological,Metachromatic leukodystrophy,"Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD, also called Arylsulfatase A deficiency) is a lysosomal storage disease which is commonly listed in the family of leukodystrophies as well as among the sphingolipidoses as it affects the metabolism of sphingolipids.

Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity. Up to one-third of people have an aura: typically a short period of visual disturbance which signals that the headache will soon occur. Occasionally, an aura can occur with little or no headache following it.Migraines are believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors. About two-thirds of cases run in families. Changing hormone levels may also play a role, as migraines affect slightly more boys than girls before puberty and two to three times more women than men. The risk of migraines usually decreases during pregnancy. The underlying mechanisms are not fully known. It is, however, believed to involve the nerves and blood vessels of the brain.Initial recommended treatment is with simple pain medication such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) for the headache, medication for the nausea, and the avoidance of triggers. Specific medications such as triptans or ergotamines may be used in those for whom simple pain medications are not effective. Caffeine may be added to the above. A number of medications are useful to prevent attacks including metoprolol, valproate, and topiramate.Globally, approximately 15% of people are affected by migraines.

Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms).

This is in contrast with myelofibrosis that develops secondary to polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia. Myelofibrosis is a form of myeloid metaplasia, which refers to a change in cell type in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow, and often the two terms are used synonymously. The terms Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) are also used to refer to myelofibrosis."1989,1047,"""Myelogenous leukemia, acute (3)""","""FACL6, ACS2""",604443,5q31,Cancer,Myelogenous leukemia,1990,1047,"""Myelogenous leukemia, acute (3)""","""IRF1, MAR""",147575,5q31.1,Cancer,Myelogenous leukemia,1991,1047,"""Myeloid leukemia, acute, M4Eo subtype (3)""",CBFB,121360,16q22,Cancer,Myeloid leukemia,"Myeloid leukemia is a type of leukemia affecting myeloid tissue.Types include:Acute myeloid leukemiaChronic myelogenous leukemia"1992,1047,"""Myeloid malignancy, predisposition to (3)""","""CSF1R, FMS""",164770,5q33.2-q33.3,Cancer,Myeloid malignancy, 1993,1049,"""Myelokathexis, isolated (3)""","""CXCR4, D2S201E, NPY3R, WHIM""",162643,2q21,Immunological,Myelokathexis,"Myelokathexis is a congenital disorder of the white blood cells that causes severe, chronic leukopenia (a reduction of circulating white blood cells) and neutropenia (a reduction of neutrophil granulocytes).

The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms, with women more likely than men to present atypically. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, or cardiac arrest.Most MIs occur due to coronary artery disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake, among others. The mechanism of an MI often involves the complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms, which may be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress, and extreme cold, among others. A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood tests, and coronary angiography. An ECG may confirm an ST elevation MI if ST elevation is present. Commonly used blood tests include troponin and less often creatine kinase MB.Aspirin is an appropriate immediate treatment for a suspected MI. Nitroglycerin or opioids may be used to help with chest pain; however, they do not improve overall outcomes. Supplemental oxygen should be used in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of breath. In ST elevation MIs treatments which attempt to restore blood flow to the heart are typically recommended and include angioplasty, where the arteries are pushed open, or thrombolysis, where the blockage is removed using medications. People who have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are often managed with the blood thinner heparin, with the additional use of angioplasty in those at high risk. In people with blockages of multiple coronary arteries and diabetes, bypass surgery (CABG) may be recommended rather than angioplasty. After an MI, lifestyle modifications, along with long term treatment with aspirin, beta blockers, and statins, are typically recommended.Worldwide, about 8.6 million myocardial infarctions occurred in 2013. More than 3 million people had an ST elevation MI and more than 4 million had an NSTEMI. STEMIs occur about twice as often in men as women. About one million people have an MI each year in the United States. In the developed world the risk of death in those who have had an STEMI is about 10%.

Symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, comparable to how people who do not have narcolepsy feel after 24â€“48 hours of sleep deprivation, as well as disturbed sleep which often is confused with insomnia. Another common symptom of narcolepsy is cataplexy, a sudden and transient episode of muscle weakness accompanied by full conscious awareness, typically (though not necessarily) triggered by emotions such as laughing, crying, terror, etc. affecting roughly 70% of people who have narcolepsy.The system which regulates sleep, arousal, and transitions between these states in humans is composed of three interconnected subsystems: the orexin projections from the lateral hypothalamus, the reticular activating system, and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. In narcoleptic individuals, these systems are all associated with impairments due to a greatly reduced number of hypothalamic orexin projection neurons and significantly fewer orexin neuropeptides in cerebrospinal fluid and neural tissue, compared to non-narcoleptic individuals. Those with narcolepsy generally experience the REM stage of sleep within five minutes of falling asleep, while people who do not have narcolepsy (unless they are significantly sleep deprived) do not experience REM until after a period of slow-wave sleep, which lasts for about the first hour or so of a sleep cycle.It is most common between ages 40 and 50 and may decline after age 60.

It is a component of glomerulonephrosis, in which different degrees of proteinuria occur. Essentially, loss of protein through the kidneys (proteinuria) leads to low protein levels in the blood (hypoproteinemia including hypoalbuminemia), which causes water to be drawn into soft tissues (edema). Very low hypoalbuminemia can also cause a variety of secondary problems, such as water in the abdominal cavity (ascites), around the heart or lung (pericardial effusion, pleural effusion), high cholesterol (hence hyperlipidemia), loss of molecules regulating coagulation (hence increased risk of thrombosis).Large proteinuria is due to an increase in permeability of the filtering membrane of the kidney which normally separates the blood from the urinary space in Bowman's capsule. This is composed of the capillary walls of the glomerulus which are wrapped by highly specialized cells called podocytes. Alterations in their capacity to filter the substances transported in the blood mean that proteins but not cells pass into the urine (hence no haematuria).

Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have one leg of a different length, and have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests occasionally used to either support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in OA, the joints do not typically become hot or red.Treatment includes exercise, efforts to decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications. Efforts to decrease joint stress include resting and the use of a cane. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen). If these do not relieve symptoms, NSAIDs such as diclofenac may be used, but these medications are associated with greater side effects. Opioids if used are generally only recommended short term due to the risk of addiction. If pain interferes with normal life despite other treatments, joint replacement surgery may help.

It is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly. Bones that commonly break include the back bones, the bones of the forearm, and the hip. Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms. Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously. Chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a broken bone.Osteoporosis may be due to lower than normal peak bone mass and greater than normal bone loss. Bone loss increases after menopause due to lower levels of estrogen. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, surgical removal of the ovaries, and kidney disease. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and steroids. Not enough exercise and smoking are also risk factors. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young adult. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the hip.Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that cause the condition. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking and not drinking alcohol may help. Medication of the bisphosphonate type are useful in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis. In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones they are less effective. A number of other medications may also be useful.Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. About 15% of white people in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected. It is more common in women than men. In the developed world, depending on the method of diagnosis, 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of females are affected. Rates of disease in the developing world are unclear. About 22 million women and 5.5 million men in the European Union had osteoporosis in 2010. In the United States in 2010 about eight million women and one to two million men had osteoporosis. White and Asian people are at greater risk.

Periodontitis is caused by microorganisms that adhere to and grow on the tooth's surfaces, along with an over-aggressive immune response against these microorganisms. A diagnosis of periodontitis is established by inspecting the soft gum tissues around the teeth with a probe (i.e., a clinical examination) and by evaluating the patient's X-ray films (i.e., a radiographic examination), to determine the amount of bone loss around the teeth.

Phenylketonuria is caused by absent or virtually absent phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme activity. Both PKU and most non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia are the result of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (PAHD).Protein-rich foods or the sweetener aspartame can act as poisons for people with phenylketonuria. The role of PAH is to break down excess phenylalanine from food. Phenylalanine is a necessary part of the human diet and is naturally present in all kinds of dietary protein. It is also used to make aspartame, known by the trade name Nutrasweet, which is used to sweeten low-calorie and sugar free soft drinks, yogurts, and desserts. In people without PKU, the PAH enzyme breaks down any excess phenylalanine from these sources beyond what is needed by the body. However, if there is not enough of the PAH enzyme or its cofactor, then phenylalanine can build up in the blood and brain to toxic levels, affecting brain development and function. PKU is rare, but important to identify, because if caught early it is very treatable. It is not contagious, and it is lifelong, but with early diagnosis and consistent treatment, the damaging effects can be minimal or non-existent.Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, and other serious medical problems. The best proven treatment for classical PKU patients is a strict phenylalanine-restricted diet supplemented by a medical formula containing amino acids and other nutrients. In the United States, the current recommendation is that the PKU diet should be maintained for life. Patients who are diagnosed early and maintain a strict diet can have a normal life span with normal mental development.PKU is an inherited disease. When an infant is diagnosed with PKU, it is never the result of any action of the parents or any environmental factor. Rather, for a child to inherit PKU, both of his or her parents must have at least one mutated allele of the PAH gene. Most parents who are carriers of PKU genes are not aware that they have this mutation because being a carrier causes no medical problems. To be affected by PKU, a child must inherit two mutated alleles, one from each parent."2292,1216,Phenylketonuria due to dihydropteridine reductase deficiency (3),"""QDPR, DHPR""",261630,4p15.31,Metabolic,Phenylketonuria due to dihydropteridine reductase deficiency, 2293,1216,Phenylketonuria due to PTS deficiency (3),PTS,261640,11q22.3-q23.3,Metabolic,Phenylketonuria due to PTS deficiency, 2294,1217,"""Phenylthiocarbamide tasting, 171200 (3)""","""TAS2R38, T2R61, PTC""",607751,7q35-q36,"""Ear,Nose,Throat""",Phenylthiocarbamide tasting, 2295,1218,"""Pheochromocytoma, 171300 (3)""","""SDHD, PGL1""",602690,11q23,Cancer,Pheochromocytoma,"A pheochromocytoma (from Greek phaios ""dark"", chroma ""color"", kytos ""cell"", -oma ""tumor"") or phaeochromocytoma (PCC) is a neuroendocrine tumor of the medulla of the adrenal glands (originating in the chromaffin cells), or extra-adrenal chromaffin tissue that failed to involute after birth, that secretes high amounts of catecholamines, mostly norepinephrine, plus epinephrine to a lesser extent.

Common characteristics include a congenital white forelock, scattered normal pigmented and hypopigmented macules and a triangular shaped depigmented patch on the forehead. There is nevertheless great variation in the degree and pattern of presentation, even within affected families. In some cases, piebaldism occurs together with severe developmental problems, as in Waardenburg syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease. It has been documented to occur in all races; early photographers captured many images of African piebalds used as a form of amusement, and George Catlin is believed to have painted several portraits of Native Americans of the Mandan tribe who were affected by piebaldism. Piebaldism is found in nearly every species of mammal. It is very common in mice, rabbits, dogs, sheep, deer, cattle and horsesâ€”where selective breeding has increased the incidence of the mutation-, but occurs among chimpanzees and other primates only as rarely as among humans. Piebaldism is completely unrelated to acquired or infectious conditions such as vitiligo or poliosis.""Pie"" is a word for multi-colored and ""bald"" is related to a root word for ""skin."" Although piebaldism may visually appear to be partial albinism, it is a fundamentally different condition. The vision problems associated with albinism are not usually present as eye pigmentation is normal. Piebaldism differs from albinism in that the affected cells maintain the ability to produce pigment but have that specific function turned off. In albinism the cells lack the ability to produce pigment altogether. Human piebaldism has been observed to be associated with a very wide range and varying degrees of endocrine disorders, and is occasionally found together with heterochromia of the irises, congenital deafness, or incomplete gastrointestinal tract development, possibly all with the common cause of premature cutting off of human fetal growth hormone during gestation. Piebaldism is a kind of neurocristopathy, involving defects of various neural crest cell lineages that include melanocytes, but also involving many other tissues derived from the neural crest. Oncogenic factors, including mistranscription, are hypothesized to be related to the degree of phenotypic variation among affected individuals.This is an autosomal dominant hereditary condition, which tends to produce high rates of inheritance and long chains of generational transmission. All who inherit the gene have at some time in life evidence of piebald hypopigmentation of the hair or skin, most likely both. Historically, persons with extensive piebaldism have experienced abuse of the sort still suffered in the present by albinos, especially in Africa. This has ranged from display of unclothed African piebalds in ""freak"" shows and post cards of the early twentieth century to the forcing of piebalds (as in the case of albinos) to work long hours exposed to the sun (producing high rates of lethal skin cancers), to the use of piebald humans, including children, in risky medical experiments. The National Organization of Albinism and Hypopigmentation, as well as organizations such as Under the Same Sun, work to promote awareness of all forms of cutaneous variation and their medical implications, and to highlight human rights issues, especially the plight of albinos subject to extreme persecution in parts of Africa.Piebaldism may be associated with the genes KIT or SNAI2."2304,1227,"""Pigmentation of hair, skin, and eyes, variation in (3)""","""MATP, AIM1""",606202,5p13.3,Dermatological,Pigmentation of hair, 2305,3229,"""Pigmented adrenocortical disease, primary isolated, 160980 (3)""","""PRKAR1A, TSE1, CNC1, CAR""",188830,17q23-q24,Cancer,Pigmented adrenocortical disease, 2306,1229,"""Pigmented paravenous chorioretinal atrophy, 172870 (3)""","""CRB1, RP12""",604210,1q31-q32.1,Ophthamological,Pigmented paravenous chorioretinal atrophy, 2307,1230,"""Pilomatricoma, 132600 (3)""",CTNNB1,116806,3p22-p21.3,Cancer,Pilomatricoma,"Pilomatricoma, also known as a calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe, Malherbe calcifying epithelioma, and Pilomatrixoma, is a benign skin tumor derived from the hair matrix.

Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all intracranial neoplasms  and the estimated prevalence rate in the general population is approximately 17%.Non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign in the literal as well as the clinical sense; however a recent meta-analysis (FernÃ¡ndez-Balsells, et al. 2011) of available research has shown there are to date scant studies - of poor quality - to either support or refute this assumption.Adenomas which exceed 10 millimetres (0.39 in) in size are defined as macroadenomas, with those smaller than 10 mm referred to as microadenomas. Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas, and have an estimated prevalence of 16.7% (14.4% in autopsy studies and 22.5% in radiologic studies). A majority of pituitary microadenomas often remain undiagnosed and those that are diagnosed are often found as an incidental finding, and are referred to as incidentalomas.Pituitary macroadenomas are the most common cause of hypopituitarism, and in the majority of cases they are non-secreting adenomas.The Pituitary gland is in close proximity to the brain, invasive adenomas may invade the dura mater, cranial bone, or sphenoid bone.

One or both lungs may be affected.A primary pneumothorax is one that occurs spontaneously without an apparent cause and in the absence of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung pathology. Pneumothoraces can be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including blast injury), or as a complication of medical or surgical intervention; in this case it is referred to as a traumatic pneumothorax. In a minority of cases of both spontaneous or traumatic pneumothorax, the amount of air in the chest increases markedly when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition is a medical emergency that can cause steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, these sequelae can progress and cause death.Symptoms typically include chest pain and shortness of breath. Diagnosis of a pneumothorax by physical examination alone can be difficult or inconclusive (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces), so a chest radiograph or computed tomography (CT) scan is usually used to confirm its presence.Small spontaneous pneumothoraces typically resolve without treatment and require only monitoring. This approach may be most appropriate in subjects who have no significant underlying lung disease. In larger pneumothoraces, or when there are marked symptoms, the air may be extracted with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgical interventions may be required when tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes)."2327,1241,"""Polycystic kidney and hepatic disease, 263200 (3)""","""FCYT, PKHD1, ARPKD""",606702,6p21.1-p12,Renal,Polycystic kidney and hepatic disease, 2328,1241,"""Polycystic kidney disease, adult type I, 173900 (3)""",PKD1,601313,16p13.3-p13.12,Renal,Polycystic kidney disease,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD or PCKD, also known as polycystic kidney syndrome) is a genetic disorder in which abnormal cysts develop and grow in the kidneys.

This rare condition affects assorted systems because of an error on an enzyme, which is affiliated with the creation of collagen. Collagen is a powerful protein that is observed in the bones, tissues, and the skin. Collagen causes the degradation of iminodipeptides. Iminodipeptides are compounds, which break down to form amino acids. Prolidase is an enzyme responsible for the breaking down of iminodipeptides. In this condition there is a defect, which causes a lack of prolidase. Those affected by PD eliminate large quantities of iminodipeptides in their urine because of a deficiency in the prolidase enzyme. When the function of prolidase operates incorrectly it results in this recessive connective tissue condition (PD).Prolidase splits dipeptides that contain C-terminal proline or hydroxyproline. When the amount of prolidase is insufficient, the typical recycling of the residues of proline, acquired from the degrading of collagen, is not functioning properly. As a result, there is an accumulation of iminodipeptides causes disruptions in the connective tissue metabolism and elimination of an excessive volume of iminodipeptides in the urine.It is estimated that about 70 people with this condition have been recorded in medical literature.

It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells.Factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.Prostate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5Î±-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not appear to affect the risk.Many cases can be safely followed with active surveillance or watchful waiting. Other treatments may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy or chemotherapy. When it only occurs inside the prostate it may be curable. In those in whom the disease has spread to the bones, pain medications, bisphosphonates and targeted therapy, among others, may be useful. Outcomes depend on a person's age and other health problems as well as how aggressive and extensive the cancer is. Most people with prostate cancer do not end up dying from the disease. The 5-year survival rate in the United States is 99%. Globally it is the second most common type of cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in men. In 2012 it occurred in 1.1 million men and caused 307,000 deaths. It was the most common cancer in males in 84 countries, occurring more commonly in the developed world. Rates have been increasing in the developing world. Detection increased significantly in the 1980s and 1990s in many areas due to increased PSA testing.

The 5-year survival rate in the United States is 99%. Globally it is the second most common type of cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in men. In 2012 it occurred in 1.1 million men and caused 307,000 deaths. It was the most common cancer in males in 84 countries, occurring more commonly in the developed world. Rates have been increasing in the developing world. Detection increased significantly in the 1980s and 1990s in many areas due to increased PSA testing. Studies of males who died from unrelated causes have found prostate cancer in 30% to 70% of those over age 60."2385,1273,Protein S deficiency (3),PROS1,176880,3p11.1-q11.2,Hematological,Protein S deficiency,"Protein S deficiency is a disorder associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis.

These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and scaly. They may vary in severity from small and localized to complete body coverage. Injury to the skin can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which is known as Koebner phenomenon.There are five main types of psoriasis: plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic. Plaque psoriasis, also known as psoriasis vulgaris, makes up about 90% of cases. It typically presents with red patches with white scales on top. Areas of the body most commonly affected are the back of the forearms, shins, around the navel, and the scalp. Guttate psoriasis has drop-shaped lesions. Pustular psoriasis presents with small non-infectious pus-filled blisters. Inverse psoriasis forms red patches in skin folds. Erythrodermic psoriasis occurs when the rash becomes very widespread, and can develop from any of the other types. Fingernails and toenails are affected in most people at some point in time. This may include pits in the nails or changes in nail color.Psoriasis is generally thought to be a genetic disease which is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are three times more likely to both be affected compared to non-identical twins; this suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress may also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.There is no cure for psoriasis. However, various treatments can help control the symptoms. These treatments may include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light, and immune system suppressing medications such as methotrexate. About 75% of cases can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects 2â€“4% of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age. Psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease, and depression.

It is still unclear what function phytanic acid plays physiologically in humans, but has been found to regulate fatty acid metabolism in the liver of mice."2431,1308,"""Renal carcinoma, chromophobe, somatic, 144700 (3)""","""FLCN, BHD""",607273,17p11.2,Cancer,Renal carcinoma,2432,1308,"""Renal cell carcinoma, 144700 (3)""","""TRC8, RCA1, HRCA1""",603046,8q24.1,Cancer,Renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport waste molecules from the blood to the urine.

Patients with the dominant version often suffer moderately from the aforementioned symptoms. Recessive cases, on the other hand, are usually more physically marked, and individuals may exhibit more skeletal abnormalities. The recessive form is particularly frequent in Turkey. However, this can likely be explained by a common ancestor, as these patients' families can be traced to a single town in Eastern Turkey. Clusters of the autosomal recessive form have also been documented in Oman and Czechoslovakia.The syndrome is also known as Robinow-Silverman-Smith syndrome, Robinow dwarfism, fetal face, fetal face syndrome, fetal facies syndrome, acral dysostosis with facial and genital abnormalities, or mesomelic dwarfism-small genitalia syndrome.

The signs and symptoms depends on the organ involved. Often there are no, or only mild, symptoms. When it affects the lungs there may be wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Some may have Lofgren's syndrome in which there is fever, large lymph nodes, arthritis, and a rash known as erythema nodosum.The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. Some believe it may be due to an immune reaction to a trigger such as an infection or chemicals in those who are genetically predisposed. Those with affected family members are at greater risk. Diagnosis is partly based on signs and symptoms, which may be supported by biopsy. Findings that make it likely include large lymph nodes at the root of the lung on both sides, high blood calcium with a normal parathyroid hormone level, or elevated levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the blood.

The disease usually begins in the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. Less commonly affected are the eyes, liver, heart, and brain. Any organ, however, can be affected. The signs and symptoms depends on the organ involved. Often there are no, or only mild, symptoms. When it affects the lungs there may be wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Some may have Lofgren's syndrome in which there is fever, large lymph nodes, arthritis, and a rash known as erythema nodosum.The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. Some believe it may be due to an immune reaction to a trigger such as an infection or chemicals in those who are genetically predisposed. Those with affected family members are at greater risk. Diagnosis is partly based on signs and symptoms, which may be supported by biopsy. Findings that make it likely include large lymph nodes at the root of the lung on both sides, high blood calcium with a normal parathyroid hormone level, or elevated levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the blood. The diagnosis should only be made after excluding other possible causes of similar symptoms such as tuberculosis.Many people clear up without any treatment within a few years. However some may have long term or severe disease. Some symptoms may be improved with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. In cases where the condition causes significant health problems steroids such as prednisone are indicated. Alternatively, medications such as methotrexate, chloroquine, or azathioprine may occasionally be used in an effort to decrease the side effects of steroids.

Additional neurological and neuromuscular symptoms such as diminished muscle tone, weakness, involuntary rapid eye movements, vision loss, and seizures may become present. With time, the symptoms worsen and children affected with this disorder will experience a decreased ability to move certain muscles due to muscle rigidity. The ability to respond to external stimuli will also decrease. Other symptoms include neuroaxonal dystrophy from birth, discoloration of skin, Telangiectasia or widening of blood vessels.In Type II adult form, symptoms are milder and may not appear until the individual is in his or her 30s.

The diagnosis is made when the patient has features of both schizophrenia and a mood disorderâ€”either bipolar disorder or depressionâ€”but does not strictly meet diagnostic criteria for either alone. The bipolar type is distinguished by symptoms of mania, hypomania, or mixed episode; the depressive type by symptoms of depression only. Common symptoms of the disorder include hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and disorganized speech and thinking. The onset of symptoms usually begins in young adulthood, currently with an uncertain lifetime prevalence because the disorder was redefined, but DSM-IV prevalence estimates were less than 1 percent of the population, in the range of 0.5 to 0.8 percent. Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the patient's reported experiences.Genetics, neurobiology, early and current environment, behavioral, social, and experiential components appear to be important contributory factors; some recreational and prescription drugs may cause or worsen symptoms. No single isolated organic cause has been found, but extensive evidence exists for abnormalities in the metabolism of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), dopamine, and glutamic acid in people with schizophrenia, psychotic mood disorders, and schizoaffective disorder. People with schizoaffective disorder are likely to have co-occurring conditions, including anxiety disorders and substance use disorder. Social problems such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is shorter than those without it, due to increased physical health problems from an absence of health promoting behaviors including a sedentary lifestyle, and a higher suicide rate.The mainstay of current treatment is antipsychotic medication combined with mood stabilizer medication or antidepressant medication, or both. There is growing concern by some researchers that antidepressants may increase psychosis, mania, and long-term mood episode cycling in the disorder. When there is risk to self or others, usually early in treatment, brief hospitalization may be necessary. Psychiatric rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and vocational rehabilitation are very important for recovery of higher psychosocial function. As a group, people with schizoaffective disorder diagnosed using DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria have a better outcome than people with schizophrenia, but have variable individual psychosocial functional outcomes compared to people with mood disorders, from worse to the same. Outcomes for people with DSM-5 diagnosed schizoaffective disorder depend on data from prospective cohort studies, which haven't been completed yet.In DSM-5 and ICD-10 (which is being revised to ICD-11, to be published in 2015), schizoaffective disorder is in the same diagnostic class as schizophrenia, but not in the same class as mood disorders. The diagnosis was introduced in 1933, and its definition was slightly changed in the DSM-5, published in May 2013, because the DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder definition leads to excessive misdiagnosis. The changes made to the schizoaffective disorder definition were intended to make the DSM-5 diagnosis more consistent (or reliable), and to substantially reduce the use of the diagnosis. Additionally, the DSM-5 schizoaffective disorder diagnosis can no longer be used for first episode psychosis."2554,1359,"""Schizophrenia 5, 603175 (3)""",TRAR4,608923,6q23.2,Psychiatric,Schizophrenia 5, 2555,1359,"""Schizophrenia, chronic (3)""","""APP, AAA, CVAP, AD1""",104760,21q21,Psychiatric,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand what is real.

It is a rare disorder, affecting only around 1 in 40,000 individuals.Schwannomas are mostly benign tumors that commonly occur in individuals with NF2 and schwannomatosis (sometimes called neurofibromatosis type III). Schwann cells are glial cells that myelinate the axons of nerve cells. Myelin is a lipid covering that speeds the conduction of action potentials. When Schwann cells proliferate out of control in an encapsulation it is called a schwannoma. Although schwannomas are benign they become detrimental when the growing tumor compresses the nerve.

Humans and certain other animal species require vitamin C in their diets for the synthesis of collagen. In infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as Barlow's disease, named after Sir Thomas Barlow, a British physician who described it in 1883. However, Barlow's disease may also refer to mitral valve prolapse. Other eponyms for scurvy include Moeller's disease and Cheadle's disease. The chemical name for vitamin C, ascorbic acid, is derived from the Latin name of scurvy, scorbutus, which also provides the adjective scorbutic (""of, characterized by or having to do with scurvy"").Typical symptoms of scurvy are initially fatigue, followed by formation of spots on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from the mucous membranes. Spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person may look pale, feel depressed, and be partially immobilized. As scurvy advances, there can be open, suppurating wounds, loss of teeth, yellow skin, fever, neuropathy and finally death from bleeding.Treatment is by a vitamin C-rich diet, whereby complete recovery from incipient scurvy takes less than two weeks. Vitamin C is widespread in plant tissues, with particularly high concentrations occurring in capsicum fruit (especially sweet green peppers), cruciferous vegetables (such as kale, broccoli and brussels sprouts), and citrus fruits (especially oranges). Organ meats such as liver contain more vitamin C than muscle meat. Cooking significantly reduces the concentration of vitamin C as does exposure to air, copper, iron, and other transition metal salts.Scurvy does not occur in most animals as they can synthesize their own vitamin C. However, humans and other higher primates, guinea pigs, most or all bats, and some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diets.Historically, Hippocrates (c. 460 BCEâ€“c. 380 BCE) described scurvy, and herbal cures for scurvy have been known in many native cultures since prehistory. Nevertheless, treatment was inconsistent, and scurvy was one of the limiting factors of marine travel, often killing large numbers of the passengers and crew on long-distance voyages. While there is earlier evidence (from the voyages of Vasco da Gama and James Lancaster, for example) that citrus fruit had a curative effect on scurvy, it was a Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind, who first proved it could be treated with citrus fruit in experiments he described in his 1753 book A Treatise of the Scurvy. These experiments in fact represented the world's first clinical trial. Unfortunately no prominence was given to this finding in a book which was long and contradictory. Lind's findings did not conform to the theories of his time, that scurvy was the result of poor digestion and the consumption of preserved meat and moldy water, and as a result had little impact on medical thinking. It would be 40 years before practical seamen and surgeons insisted on issuing lemon juice and effective prevention became widespread. Scurvy remained a problem during expeditions and in wartime until the mid-20th century."2568,1366,"""Sea-blue histiocyte disease, 269600 (3)""","""APOE, AD2""",107741,19q13.2,Hematological,Sea-blue histiocyte disease, 2569,1367,"""Seasonal affective disorder, susceptibility to, 608516 (3)""",HTR2A,182135,13q14-q21,Psychiatric,Seasonal affective disorder,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), also known as winter depression, winter blues, summer depression, summertime sadness, or seasonal depression, is a mood disorder subset in which people who have normal mental health throughout most of the year experience depressive symptoms at the same time each year, most commonly in the winter.In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV and DSM-5, its status was changed. It is no longer classified as a unique mood disorder but is now a specifier called with seasonal pattern for recurrent major depressive disorder that occurs at a specific time of the year and fully remits otherwise. Although experts were initially skeptical, this condition is now recognized as a common disorder. SAD's prevalence in the U.S. ranges from 1.4% in Florida to 9.9% in Alaska.The U.S. National Library of Medicine notes that ""some people experience a serious mood change when the seasons change.

Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. In the very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system, there may be no symptoms of a specific infection and the body temperature may be low or normal rather than high. Severe sepsis is sepsis causing poor organ function or insufficient blood flow. Insufficient blood flow may be evident by low blood pressure, high blood lactate, or low urine output. Septic shock is low blood pressure due to sepsis that does not improve after reasonable amounts of intravenous fluids are given.Sepsis is caused by an immune response triggered by an infection. The infection is most commonly bacterial, but it can be from fungi, viruses, or parasites. Common locations for the primary infection include lungs, brain, urinary tract, skin, and abdominal organs. Risk factors include young or old age, a weakened immune system from conditions such as cancer or diabetes, and major trauma or burns. Diagnosis was based on meeting at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria due to a presumed infection. In 2016 screening by SIRS was replaced with qSOFA which is two of the following three: increased breathing rate, change in level of consciousness, and low blood pressure. Blood cultures are recommended preferably before antibiotics are started; however, infection of the blood is not required for the diagnosis. Medical imaging should be done to look for the possible location of infection. Other potential causes of similar signs and symptoms include anaphylaxis, adrenal insufficiency, low blood volume, heart failure, and pulmonary embolism among others.Sepsis is usually treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Antibiotics are typically given as soon as possible. This is often done in an intensive care unit. If fluid replacement is not enough to maintain blood pressure, medications that raise blood pressure can be used. Mechanical ventilation and dialysis may be needed to support the function of the lungs and kidneys, respectively. To guide treatment, a central venous catheter and an arterial catheter may be placed for access to the bloodstream. Other measurements such as cardiac output and superior vena cava oxygen saturation may be used. People with sepsis need preventive measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers and pressure ulcers, unless other conditions prevent such interventions. Some might benefit from tight control of blood sugar levels with insulin. The use of corticosteroids is controversial. Activated drotrecogin alfa, originally marketed for severe sepsis, has not been found to be helpful and was withdrawn from sale in 2011.Disease severity partly determines the outcome with the risk of death from sepsis being as high as 30%, severe sepsis as high as 50%, and septic shock as high as 80%. The number of cases worldwide is unknown as there is little data from the developing world. Estimates suggest sepsis affects millions of people a year. In the developed world about 0.2 to 3 per 1000 people get sepsis yearly or about a million cases per year in the United States. Rates of disease have been increasing. Sepsis is more common among males than females. The condition has been described at least since the time of Hippocrates.

It can cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (formerly known as multiple organ failure) and death. Its most common victims are children, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly, as their immune systems cannot deal with infection as effectively as those of healthy adults. Frequently, patients suffering from septic shock are cared for in intensive care units.

Heterotaxy in general refers to any defect of left-right laterality and arrangement of the visceral organs. This does not include the congenital defect situs inversus, which results when arrangement of the organs in the abdomen and chest are mirrored, so the positions are opposite the normal placement. Situs inversus is the mirror image of situs solitus, which is normal asymmetric distribution of the abdominothoracic visceral organs. Patients with situs ambiguous are considered isomeric in that they have organs with 2-right-sides or 2-left-sides, most commonly observed in relation to the atria of the heart.Individuals with situs inversus or situs solitus do not experience fatal dysfunction of their organ systems, as general anatomy and morphology of the abdominothoracic organ-vessel systems are conserved. Unfortunately, due to abnormal arrangement of organs in situs ambiguous, orientation across the left-right axis of the body is disrupted early in fetal development, resulting in severely flawed cardiac development and function in 50-80% of cases. They also experience complications with systemic and pulmonary blood vessels, significant morbidity, and sometimes death. All patients with situs ambiguous lack lateralization and symmetry of organs in the abdominal and thoracic cavities and are clinically considered to have a form of heterotaxy syndrome.Heterotaxy syndrome with atrial isomerism occurs in 1 out of every 10,000 live births and is associated with approximately 3% of congenital heart disease cases. Additional estimation of incidence and prevalence of isomerism proves difficult due to failure to diagnose and underestimation of the disease by clinicians. Furthermore, right isomerism is much more easily recognized than left isomerism contributing to the failure to diagnose.Situs ambiguous is a growing field of research with findings dating back to 1973."2616,1399,"""Situs inversus viscerum, 270100 (3)""","""DNAH11, DNAHC11""",603339,Chr.7,Developmental,Situs inversus viscerum,2617,1400,"""Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, 270200 (3)""","""ALDH3A2, ALDH10, SLS, FALDH""",609523,17p11.2,Metabolic,Sjogren-Larsson syndrome,2618,1401,"""Skin fragility-woolly hair syndrome, 607655 (3)""","""DSP, KPPS2, PPKS2""",125647,6p24,Dermatological,Skin fragility-woolly hair syndrome, 2619,1403,Slow acetylation (3),"""NAT2, AAC2""",243400,8p23.1-p21.3,Metabolic,Slow acetylation, 2620,1404,"""Slowed nerve conduction velocity, AD, 608236 (3)""","""ARHGEF10, KIAA0294""",608136,8p23,Neurological,Slowed nerve conduction velocity, 2621,1406,"""Small patella syndrome, 147891 (3)""",TBX4,601719,17q21-q22,Skeletal,Small patella syndrome, 2622,1408,"""SMED Strudwick type, 184250 (3)""",COL2A1,120140,12q13.11-q13.2,Skeletal,SMED Strudwick type, 2623,1409,"""Smith-Fineman-Myers syndrome, 309580 (3)""","""ATRX, XH2, XNP, MRXS3, SHS""",300032,Xq13,multiple,Smith-Fineman-Myers syndrome,"This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title; for example, its words are rearranged, or punctuation in the name is changed.

Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes.The most common cause is infection by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Certain types of H. pylori have greater risks than others. Other common causes include eating pickled vegetables and smoking. About 10% of cases run in families and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer.A Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of cancer as does the stopping of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating H. pylori decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% 5-year survival rate globally. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease. In the United States 5-year survival is 28% while in South Korea it is over 65% partly due to screening efforts.Globally stomach cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer and the third leading cause of death from cancer making up 7% of cases and 9% of deaths. In 2012 it occurred in 950,000 people and caused 723,000 deaths. Before the 1930s in much of the world, including most Western developed countries, it was the most common cause of death from cancer. Rates of death have been decreasing in many areas of the world since then. This is believed to be due to the eating of less salted and pickled foods as a result of the development of refrigeration as a method of keeping food fresh. Stomach cancer occurs most commonly in East Asia and Eastern Europe. It occurs twice as often in males as in females."2702,1454,"""Stroke, susceptibility to, 1, 606799 (3)""","""PDE4D, DPDE3, STRK1""",600129,5q12,Cardiovascular,Stroke,"Stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident (CVA), cerebrovascular insult (CVI), or brain attack, is when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side among others. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Hemorrhagic strokes may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, previous TIA, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by bleeding either directly into the brain or into the space surrounding the brain. Bleeding may occur due to a brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically with medical imaging such as a computerized axial tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan along with a physical exam. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms.Prevention includes decreasing risk factors as well as possibly aspirin, statins, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic narrowing, and warfarin in those with atrial fibrillation. A stroke often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Aspirin should be used. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from surgery. Treatment to try recover lost function is called stroke rehabilitation and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however, these are not available in much of the world.In 2013 approximately 6.9 million people had an ischemic stroke and 3.4 million people had a hemorrhagic stroke. In 2010 there were about 33 million people who had previously had a stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes which occurred each year decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world. In 2013, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.4 million deaths (12% of the total).

The disorder has been identified in approximately 350 families, with a significant proportion being consanguineous families. The first case was identified in 1981 and published in a Dutch clinical chemistry journal that highlighted a person with a number of neurological conditions such as delayed intellectual, motor, speech, and language as the most common manifestations. Later cases reported in the early 1990s began to show that hypotonia, hyporeflexia, seizures, and a nonprogressive ataxia were frequent clinical features as well.SSADH deficiency is caused by an enzyme deficiency in GABA degradation. Under normal conditions, SSADH works with the enzyme GABA transaminase to convert GABA to succinic acid. Succinic acid can then be utilized for energy production via the Krebs cycle. However, because of the deficiency, the final intermediate of the GABA degradation pathway, succinic semialdehyde, accumulates and cannot be oxidized to succinic acid and is therefore reduced to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) by gamma-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase. This causes elevations in GHB and is believed to be the trademark of this disorder and cause for the neurological manifestations seen."2708,1458,Sucrose intolerance (3),SI,222900,3q25-q26,Metabolic,Sucrose intolerance,"Sucrose intolerance, also called congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) or sucrase-isomaltase deficiency, is the condition in which sucrase, an enzyme needed for proper metabolism of sucrose (sugar), is not produced in the small intestine.It is common among the Inupiat people."2709,1459,"""Sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome, 608800 (3)""","""TSPYL1, TSPYL, SIDDT""",604714,6q22-q23,Unclassified,Sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome, 2710,1460,"""Sulfite oxidase deficiency, 272300 (3)""",SUOX,606887,Chr.12,Metabolic,Sulfite oxidase deficiency,2711,1461,"""Superoxide dismutase, elevated extracellular (3)""",SOD3,185490,4p15.3-p15.1,Unclassified,Superoxide dismutase,"Superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) is an enzyme that alternately catalyzes the dismutation (or partitioning) of the superoxide (O2âˆ’) radical into either ordinary molecular oxygen (O2) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses platelets (thrombocytes) and fibrin to form a blood clot to prevent blood loss. Even when a blood vessel is not injured, blood clots may form in the body under certain conditions. A clot that breaks free and begins to travel around the body is known as an embolus.When a thrombus is significantly large enough to reduce the blood flow to a tissue, hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) can occur and metabolic products such as lactic acid can accumulate. A larger thrombus causing a much greater obstruction to the blood flow may result in anoxia, the complete deprivation of oxygen and infarction, tissue death. There are also a number of other conditions that can arise according to the location of the thrombus and the organs affected.Thromboembolism is the combination of thrombosis and its main complication, embolism."2766,1497,"""Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, familial, 274150 (3)""","""ADAMTS13, VWFCP, TTP""",604134,9q34,Hematological,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome) is a rare disorder of the blood-coagulation system, causing extensive microscopic clots to form in the small blood vessels throughout the body. These small blood clots, called thrombi, can damage many organs including the kidneys, heart and brain. In the era before effective treatment with plasma exchange, the fatality rate was about 90%. With plasma exchange, this has dropped to 10% at six months. Immunosuppressants, such as glucocorticoids, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, or ciclosporin, may also be used if a relapse or recurrence follows plasma exchange.Most cases of TTP arise from autoantibody-mediated inhibition of the enzyme ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease responsible for cleaving large multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) into smaller units. The increase in circulating multimers of vWF increases platelet adhesion to areas of endothelial injury, particularly at arteriole-capillary junctions.A rarer form of TTP, called Upshawâ€“Schulman syndrome, is genetically inherited as a dysfunction of ADAMTS13, resulting in persisting large vWF multimers.Red blood cells passing the microscopic clots are subjected to shear stress which damages their membranes, leading to rupture of red blood cells within blood vessels, which in turn leads to anaemia and schistocyte formation. Reduced blood flow due to thrombosis and cellular injury results in end organ damage. Current therapy is based on support and plasmapheresis to reduce circulating antibodies against ADAMTS13 and replenish blood levels of the enzyme."2767,1494,"""Thrombycytosis, susceptibility to, 187950 (3)""","""MPL, TPOR, MPLV""",159530,1p34,Hematological,Thrombycytosis, 2768,1502,Thymine-uraciluria (3),"""DPYD, DPD""",274270,1p22,Metabolic,Thymine-uraciluria, 2769,1503,"""Thyroid adenoma, hyperfunctioning (3)""",TSHR,603372,14q31,Cancer,Thyroid adenoma,A thyroid adenoma is a benign tumor of the thyroid gland.2770,1503,Thyroid carcinoma (3),"""TP53, P53, LFS1""",191170,17p13.1,Cancer,Thyroid carcinoma,2771,1503,"""Thyroid carcinoma, follicular, 188470 (3)""","""MINPP1, HIPER1""",605391,10q23,Cancer,Thyroid carcinoma,2772,1503,"""Thyroid carcinoma, follicular, 188470 (3)""","""PTEN, MMAC1""",601728,10q23.31,Cancer,Thyroid carcinoma,2773,1503,"""Thyroid carcinoma, follicular, somatic, 188470 (3)""",HRAS,190020,11p15.5,Cancer,Thyroid carcinoma,2774,1503,"""Thyroid carcinoma, papillary, 188550 (3)""","""GOLGA5, RFG5, PTC5""",606918,14q,Cancer,Thyroid carcinoma,2775,1503,"""Thyroid carcinoma, papillary, 188550 (3)""","""NCOA4, ELE1, PTC3""",601984,10q11.2,Cancer,Thyroid carcinoma,2776,1503,"""Thyroid carcinoma, papillary, 188550 (3)""","""PCM1, PTC4""",600299,8p22-p21.3,Cancer,Thyroid carcinoma,2777,1503,"""Thyroid carcinoma, papillary, 188550 (3)""","""PRKAR1A, TSE1, CNC1, CAR""",188830,17q23-q24,Cancer,Thyroid carcinoma,2778,1503,"""Thyroid carcinoma, papillary, 188550 (3)""","""TIF1G, RFG7, PTC7""",605769,1p13,Cancer,Thyroid carcinoma,2779,1503,"""Thyroid carcinoma, papillary, 188550 (3)""","""TRIM24, TIF1, TIF1A, PTC6""",603406,7q32-q34,Cancer,Thyroid carcinoma,2780,3503,"""Thyroid hormone organification defect IIA, 274500 (3)""","""TPO, TPX""",606765,2p25,Endocrine,Thyroid hormone organification defect IIA, 2781,3503,"""Thyroid hormone resistance, 188570 (3)""","""THRB, ERBA2, THR1""",190160,3p24.3,Endocrine,Thyroid hormone resistance,"Thyroid hormone resistance (sometimes Refetoff syndrome) describes a rare syndrome in which the thyroid hormone levels are elevated but the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level is not suppressed, or not completely suppressed as would be expected.

The condition may be life-threatening if weakness of the breathing muscles leads to respiratory failure, or if the low potassium levels lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate). If untreated, it is typically recurrent in nature.The condition has been linked with genetic mutations in genes that code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes (sodium and potassium) across cell membranes. The main ones are the L-type calcium channel Î±1-subunit and potassium inward rectifier 2.6; it is therefore classified as a channelopathy. The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells, under conditions of high thyroxine (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional precipitant.Treatment of the hypokalemia, followed by correction of the hyperthyroidism, leads to complete resolution of the attacks.
